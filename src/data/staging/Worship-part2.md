But remember: only the High Priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and even then, only once a year on the Day of Atonement. For us, Christ alone is that High Priest who has entered once for all into the true Holy Place in heaven (Hebrews 9:11–12, 24).

> *"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things having come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made by hands, that is, not of this creation; 12and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all time, having obtained eternal redemption."*  
> — **Hebrews 9:11-12**
> *"For Christ did not enter a holy place made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;"*  
> — **Hebrews 9:24**

## Old Testament Example of Biblical Worship

- Israel’s High Priest entered the Holy of Holies into the Presence of God.  
- The Tabernacle illustration:  
  - Gate → Altar → 2nd Curtain → Holy Place.  
  - Outer Court → Holy Place → Holy of Holies.  
  - Ark of the Covenant: manna, rod that budded, tablets.  
  - Lampstand, showbread, altar of incense.  
- Only one gate into the outer court.  
- John 14:6 *"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me."*  
- The curtain veil torn (Matthew 27:50-51) — showing Jesus is our High Priest.  
- Resurrection as firstfruits.  
- We don’t move until God says to move.

### Redeem Two Peoples (Stars and Sand)

**Genesis 15:9-20**  
> *So He said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds... On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.”*  

- Heifer = sin offering.  
- Female goat = sins imputed (Leviticus 16).  
- Ram = substitution.  
- Turtledove = peace.  
- Pigeon = singleness of purpose.  
- God made covenant with Himself on Abram’s behalf.  
- Promise of the land.  
- The Tabernacle pictures Christ (John 1:14).  
  - *“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt (tabernacled) among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.”*
