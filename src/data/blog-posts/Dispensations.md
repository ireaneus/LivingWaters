Dispensations refer to God’s sovereign oversight of human history—
the belief that God has ordered history into seven distinct periods in His redemptive plan, each revealing a different aspect of His relationship with humanity.
✨ These are not different ways of salvation but different ways God administers His purposes over time.
The 7 Dispensations in Scripture:
1️⃣ Innocence (Genesis 1:26–31; 2:7–25)
Creation to the Fall — Humanity in perfect fellowship with God
2️⃣ Conscience (Genesis 3:1–24; 4:1–26; 5–6)
Fall to the Flood — Guided by moral conscience
3️⃣ Government (Genesis 8:20–22; 9:1–17)
After the Flood — God delegates human government
4️⃣ Patriarch Rule (Genesis 12:1–3; 15:1–21; 17:1–8; 28:13–15)
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob — God’s covenant of promise
5️⃣ Law (Exodus 19–24; Deuteronomy 4–34)
Moses to Christ — Israel under the Mosaic Law
6️⃣ Grace / Church Age (John 1:17; Acts 2; Romans–Philemon)
Christ’s resurrection to the Rapture — Salvation by grace through faith; the Spirit-indwelling Church
7️⃣ Kingdom / Millennial Reign (Isaiah 2:1–4; 11:1–10; Revelation 20:1–6)
Christ’s future 1,000-year reign on earth
