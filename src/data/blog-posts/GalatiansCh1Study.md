## **Session 2: Guarding Against Distortion**

### Key Passage: Galatians 1:6-9

> *I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel, which is not just another account; but there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.*

### Discussion Questions

1. What does Paul mean by a “different gospel”? How does he describe its impact on the church?

>
> *For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation.*
