## Purpose and Foundation

The goal of Bible study is not simply information, but transformation. The Word of God is sufficient to equip the believer for every good work[^1]. It is alive and active, judging the thoughts and intentions of the heart[^2].

> “The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed.”
>
> “The Old is the New contained; the New is the Old explained.” – Often attributed to Augustine, this thought is echoed by Spurgeon and A.W. Pink as a summary of redemptive continuity.

These sayings emphasize that the entire Bible is a unified story, progressively revealing God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ.

## Proper Scripture Interpretation (Hermeneutics)

### 1. Observation

- What does the passage say?
- Identify key terms, structure, repetition, and literary form.
- *Example:* Immaturity and sluggishness noted in Hebrews 5:11–14.

### 2. Interpretation

- What does it mean in context?
- Consider historical, cultural, grammatical, and literary context.
- *Example:* Hebrews 6:1–2 lists foundational doctrines.

### 3. Correlation

- Scripture interprets Scripture.
- Cross-reference and harmonize:

  - *Luke 24:27* — Jesus is revealed in all Scripture.
  - *Acts 17:2–3*, *Acts 18:28* — Paul reasons from the Scriptures.

### 4. Application

- What is the Spirit saying?
- *Romans 12:2* — transformation through renewal of the mind.
- *James 1:22* — be doers, not merely hearers.

## Four Foundational Laws of Interpretation

### 1. Golden Rule of Interpretation

“When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense; therefore, take every word at its primary, ordinary, usual, literal meaning, unless the facts of the immediate context indicate otherwise.”

### 2. Law of Double Reference

A single passage may speak of two distinct persons or events separated by time.

- *Isaiah 61:1–2* (fulfilled partially in Luke 4:18–19)
- *Zechariah 9:9–10* (first and second comings)

### 3. Law of Recurrence

A later passage expands upon a previously mentioned event or truth.

- *Genesis 1:26–27* / *Genesis 2:7–25*
- *Ezekiel 38–39*

### 4. Law of Context

“A text apart from its context is a pretext.” Interpret all passages in light of their immediate and broader context.

## Messianic Prophecy Structure

### Types of Prophecies

- **First Coming Only** — *Isaiah 53:1–12*, *Micah 5:2*
- **Second Coming Only** — *Isaiah 63:1–6*, *Zechariah 14:1–9*
- **Blended First and Second** — *Zechariah 9:9–10*, *Isaiah 61:1–2*
- **Whole Redemptive Career** — *Psalm 22*, *Psalm 110*, *Isaiah 53*, *Daniel 7:13–14*

---

## New Testament Usage of Old Testament

### Literal Fulfillment

- *Matthew 2:5–6* → *Micah 5:2*
- *Matthew 1:22–23* → *Isaiah 7:14*

### Literal Plus Typology

- *Matthew 2:15* → *Hosea 11:1*
- *John 19:36* → *Exodus 12:46*
- *Hebrews* — rich with typology from the Law

### Literal Plus Application

- *Matthew 2:17–18* → *Jeremiah 31:15*
- *Acts 2:16–21* → *Joel 2:28–32*

### Prophetic Summation

- *Matthew 2:23*, *Luke 18:31–33*, *Matthew 26:54–56* — “spoken by the prophets” as collective reference

## Biblical Examples: Discernment and Rediscovery

### Josiah and the Rediscovered Word

- *2 Kings 22:1–20* — Word of God rediscovered in the temple, conviction and repentance followed

### Immature Believers and Lack of Discernment

- *Hebrews 5:11–14* — believers dull of hearing, lacking discernment

### Scripture’s Sufficiency

- *Luke 16:29–31* — “They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.”
- *Psalm 138:2* — God magnifies His Word above His Name

## Hermeneutics from Arnold Fruchtenbaum

Fruchtenbaum teaches a literal, historical, grammatical approach centered on Christ and consistent with Jewish context.

### Four-Part Method

1. **Observation** – See what the text says (terms, structure, form)
2. **Interpretation** – Understand in context (genre: historical, prophetic, poetic, apocalyptic)
3. **Evaluation and Application** – Discern what truths are timeless vs. contextual
4. **Correlation** – Harmonize with full biblical doctrine and covenants (distinguishing dispensations)

### Four Key Rules

- **Golden Rule of Interpretation**
- **Law of Double Reference**
- **Law of Recurrence**
- **Law of Context**

Fruchtenbaum also outlines:

- Four types of Messianic prophecy: first coming, second coming, blended, full redemptive timeline
- How NT quotes OT: literal, typical, applied, or summarized
- Emphasis on God's covenants, Israel’s role, and Christ as the fulfillment of the Law and Prophets
