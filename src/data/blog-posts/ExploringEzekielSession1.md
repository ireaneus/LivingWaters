## HOW TO USE THIS WORKBOOK

What should you look for when you open your Bible? How do you draw out the meaning from what you are reading? And how do you make it work in your life?

Over the years of teaching people how to study the Scriptures, we have refined the process and will be using the following fourfold approach to the book of Ezekiel as spelled out in this chart.

---

## EXPLORE THE BIBLE YOURSELF

1. **CAPTURE THE SCENE** (What do I see?)
2. **ANALYZE THE MESSAGE** (What does it mean?)
3. **COMPARE THIS CHAPTER WITH THE REST OF SCRIPTURE** (How is it supported elsewhere in the Bible?)
4. **EXECUTE** (How does this affect my life?)

---

### CAPTURE THE SCENE (What do I see?)

This is the observation stage. As you read the Scriptures, you want to examine the passage with a series of questions, including, What am I seeing? What am I feeling? Who is speaking? Who are the main characters in the passage? What is he (or are they) saying? Why is he saying what he is saying? When is this situation taking place? Where is it occurring?

---

### ANALYZE THE MESSAGE (What does it mean?)

At this stage, you want to dig a bit deeper and see what you can learn from the passage. What teaching is present here? What instructions am I being given? What is the intent of this passage?

---

### COMPARE THIS PASSAGE WITH THE REST OF SCRIPTURE (How is it supported elsewhere in the Bible?)

Our understanding of God’s Word is always enhanced when we look to the surrounding context or parallel passages. There is much to gain when we examine comparable stories or teachings in Scripture.

---

### EXECUTE (How does this affect my life?)

This is the application stage. Once we let the passage speak for itself and understand it, we’re ready to search for any life lessons that might be present in it. At this point, we ask, What can I learn about God or Christ? What doctrine or principle is taught here? And how can I take these lessons to heart so they influence how I think and live?

With these guidelines in place, let us now begin our study of Ezekiel!

## LESSON 1

### EXPERIENCING GOD’S OTHERNESS

**EZEKIEL 1–3**

The people of Israel had fallen far. They had turned their backs to God, and they had done so with reckless abandon. As they shamelessly pursued other gods and the desires of the flesh, God grieved.

This wasn’t anything new. Centuries earlier, during the era of the judges, the people went through cycles of rebellion and restoration—repeatedly. Tragically, they simply would not learn from the error of their ways. Each time they came back to God in repentance, it didn’t take long for them to wander off again.

When the Hebrews were still relatively new to the Promised Land, the great military commander Joshua had admonished them, “Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord” (Joshua 24:15).

But it didn’t take long for the people to forget Joshua’s words. With each successive generation, they descended deeper into idolatry and immorality. Instead of being characterized as a nation who served the Lord, “everyone did what was right in his own eyes” (Judges 21:25). Rejecting God and His ways, they made poor choices that led to unspeakable depravity and wickedness.

---

The people of Israel embraced sin so enthusiastically that there was no longer any difference between them and their pagan neighbors. Those whom God had chosen to be distinct—to be a witness to the other nations—had lost their distinctiveness. The spiritual darkness was great, and so was God’s anger.

This is the setting in which God called the prophet Ezekiel. While it was an honor to be chosen as a spokesman for God, the job assigned to Ezekiel was daunting. God warned Ezekiel what he would be up against, saying, “The house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted” (Ezekiel 3:7).

Not only had the people spurned God, but they had also forgotten about one of His most fearsome warnings made centuries earlier through Moses. Before they entered the Promised Land, the Lord told them, “If your heart turns away so that you do not hear, and are drawn away, and worship other gods and serve them, I announce to you today that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to go in and possess” (Deuteronomy 30:17–18).

If your heart turns away, you shall surely perish.

Because God keeps His promises—including those that have to do with judgment—He had to follow through. God had waited patiently on the people of Israel, to no avail. Punishment was necessary—and imminent.

## ANALYZE THE MESSAGE (What does it say and mean?)

Using both your Bible and your copy of *Exploring Ezekiel*, answer the following questions.

1. **Ezekiel has one of the more dramatic calls in Scripture. It begins with a vision in which he sees angels and other supernatural things he is unable to describe. Ultimately, he ends up before God’s throne. What impression do you imagine the vision left on Ezekiel?**
   1. This representation of God's Glory was merely a *'Dim shadow'* of unapproachable light (1 Tim 6:16)

2. **In light of the fact Ezekiel fell prostrate before God’s throne, what kind of accountability do you think he felt for fulfilling his commission?**
   1. Complete obedience, no wavering to the right or left. Experience the Judgement himself to the same extend of the ones he is speaking to.

3. **Ezekiel’s task was difficult: Alert the rebellious people of Israel and tell them judgment was coming. In Ezekiel 2:5, God said, *“As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse… yet they will know that a prophet has been among them.”* Why do you think God wanted His defiant people to recognize they were hearing from a true prophet of the Lord? (For helpful insight on this, see how Romans 1:20 ends.)**
   1. *so that they are without excuse.*

4. **In Ezekiel 3:7, God told the prophet, *“The house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to Me.”* Even though the people wanted nothing to do with God, the Lord chose to send Ezekiel to alert them about the consequences of their sin. What does this tell you about the character of God?**
   1. *It shows His Grace, once again demonstrating His mercy. Revealing to them the sins they are committing against Him.*

5. **In Ezekiel 3:17, God said to Ezekiel, *“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel.”* According to Ezekiel 33:6–9, what was Ezekiel’s responsibility as a watchman, and in what way would God hold him accountable?**
   1. *He is to take the Lord's message to the wicked of Israel and if he doesn't the blood of those shed will be on his head.*

---

## COMPARE THIS PASSAGE WITH THE REST OF SCRIPTURE (How is it supported elsewhere in the Bible?)

1. **The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel and the apostle John all had visions of God’s throne room. Read Isaiah 6:1–2; Ezekiel 1:13–14, 26–28; and Revelation 4:2–8. What similarities do you find in these three descriptions?**

> **Isaiah 6:1-2** - *"In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew."*  
> **Ezekiel 1:13-14; 26-28** - *"In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches darting back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire. And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning."* 26 - 28 *"Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man. Then I noticed from the appearance of His loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw something like fire; and there was a radiance around Him. As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking."*  
> **Revelation 4:2-8** - *"Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne. And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads. Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God; and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind. The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.”*

> *They each mention a throne and one who sits on it. Cherubim and Seraphim around it.*

2. **What parallels can you find in Ezekiel 3:1–4, Jeremiah 15:16, and Revelation 10:9–11? Why do you think it was important for all three men to internalize God’s Word?**

> *Reading words on paper, doesn't make you believe it, it just makes you have knowledge. knowledge puffs up but as Psalm 119 speaks on having the word in my heart, that I might not sin against thee*

3. **What did Ezekiel do when he was brought before the Lord (Ezekiel 1:28)? When the prophet Isaiah “saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne” (Isaiah 6:1), how did he respond (verse 5)?**

> *woe is me, I have seen the Lord, a man of unclean lips, living with unclean men*  

4. **Both Ezekiel and Isaiah were prophets who loved God and were loyal to Him. Why, then, do you think they trembled so greatly in the Lord’s presence?**

> *both experienced a Holy God visibly and being in the presence of holiness, just knowing  how totally depraved, shameful and we are nothing He is everything.*

## EXECUTE (How does this affect my life?)

1. **Every believer has a unique calling from God. Though yours won’t be as dramatic as Ezekiel’s, it is still important because God Himself has chosen exactly where He wants to place you for His purposes. For each of the verses below, write what you learn about God’s involvement and calling in your life.**

a. **Psalm 139:13–16** — *"For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb.I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth; Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them."*

> *He leads me and guides my steps, He knows me in my inner being.  He knows me and when I will fail Him and when I serve Him.*

b. **Romans 12:1–2** — *"Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect."*

> *My life is hidden in Christ, I was bought with a price. The only thing I have to offer is  my body, my life is not my own.*

c. **1 Corinthians 7:17** — *"Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches."*

> *where God has placed you, walk worthy of the manner of the walk of Christ.*

d. **Ephesians 1:4–6** — *"Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved."*

> *He has chosen me before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless.*

e. **Ephesians 2:10** — *"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."*

> *He also created good works beforehand for us to do.*

f. **1 Peter 2:9** — *"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;"*

2. **Every person whom God calls has a unique place in the body of Christ. Based on where God has put you, how do you think He wants to use you?**

3. **First Corinthians 12:7 says, “The manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all.” Every one of us is spiritually gifted in ways that benefit fellow believers. With that in mind, answer the following:**

a. How have you been helped by the spiritual giftedness of others in your life?

b. How have you helped others through your spiritual giftedness?

4. **God called Ezekiel to urge the Israelites to turn from their rebellious ways. Likewise, there are times when God will use us as vessels to speak to fellow believers who are struggling with sin. When it comes to admonishing a brother or sister in Christ, what does Ephesians 4:15 say we should do?**

5. **What insights do you gain from Galatians 6:1–4 about coming alongside a fellow believer who has been “overtaken in any trespass”?**

6. **Ezekiel’s calling as a prophet required him to be a watchman to the people of Israel. According to the following verses, in what ways can we, as believers, equip ourselves to be spiritual watchmen to those around us?**

a. **Acts 17:11** —

b. **1 Thessalonians 5:21–22** —

c. **2 Timothy 2:15** —

7. **While we should not expect to be given a vision of God in His throne room, what are some ways we experience God’s glory today?**

## CLOSING THOUGHTS

On page 33 of *Exploring Ezekiel*, we read this about Ezekiel and Jeremiah feeding upon God’s words:

> This eating of the word of God is a poignant activity. It emphasizes to the prophets that the message they were carrying to the masses was from Him. It was a tactile experience to point out what they already knew mentally. For each of them, when the pushback may have been at its greatest, they had that scroll-swallowing moment...

...to remind themselves that these difficult words they were speaking were from God and were 100 percent accurate.

In this way, the prophets were emboldened so they could persevere in the face of opposition.

We, too, can expect to get a hostile response when we let Scripture direct how we speak and live before unbelievers. John 3:20 describes the natural response of those who love darkness: “Everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.”

While we prefer to be liked rather than disliked, we know that as believers, our goal should be to please God, not people. And as Matthew 5:11–12 says, not only are we promised reward for any rejection we face, but we will find ourselves in good company with the likes of Jeremiah and Ezekiel:

> Blessed are you when [people] revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
