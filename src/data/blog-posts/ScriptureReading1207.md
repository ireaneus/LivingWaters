**Read:** Luke 24:13-27

Have you ever noticed that when someone speaks from another room, you instinctively turn your head toward the sound? And if their shadow appears in the hallway, your eyes fix on the shadow while the voice continues. But the moment the person actually steps into the room, your eyes immediately shift from the shadow to the person.

In the same way, Scripture is filled with shadows — people, stories, sacrifices, events — that point to the real Person who is speaking. Jesus Himself said that all of Scripture points to Him.

## Scripture

### The Road to Emmaus

> 13 And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.  
> 14 And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.  
> 15 While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them.  
> 16 But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.  
> 17 And He said to them, *“What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?”* And they stood still, looking sad.  
> 18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, *“Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?”*  
> 19 And He said to them, *“What things?”* And they said to Him, *“The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,*  
> 20 *and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him.*  
> 21 *But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened.*  
> 22 *But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,*  
> 23 *and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.*  
> 24 *Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.”*  
> 25 *And He said to them, *“O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!*  
> 26 *Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?”*  
> 27 Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.

### John 5:39

> *You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;*

### The Road to Emmaus Moment We All Wish We Had

Wouldn’t it be incredible to have been on that road with Jesus — listening to Him walk us through the Old Testament, showing how every thread of Scripture weaves together and finds its fulfillment in His life, death, and resurrection?

And yet… in a very real sense, we do have something Jesus said was even better.

He promised us His Spirit — the One who “reveals all things” (1 Corinthians 2:10) and who *“will guide you into all the truth”* (John 16:13).

This is why, when we open God’s Word, we pray:

*“Lord, reveal Yourself to me in Your holy Word.”*

### A Glimpse of Heaven

But I'm drifting into preaching — Pastor Wayne will do that, and he is a faithful man of God who will lead us closer to the Good Shepherd.

Still… I can’t help imagining how it will be in Kingdom — to sit by a quiet stream with Jesus, maybe with close friends or family around us, and simply listen as He explains His Word.

To sit at the feet of Jesus

### Prayer

Lord, we long to see you return, we are so thankful that you chose us, and saved us, and that we will spend eternity at your feet, glorifying and worshipping you.  But for today, Lord reveal Yourself to us, speak through Pastor Wayne, let his words be your words, for we long to hear from you.  Conform us to your image daily and forgive us where we fail you. Yours is the kingdom and the glory, in your son's name. Amen.
