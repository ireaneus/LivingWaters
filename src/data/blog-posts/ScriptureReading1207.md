## Scripture

### The Road to Emmaus

> 13 And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.  
> 14 And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.  
> 15 While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them.  
> 16 But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.  
> 17 And He said to them, *“What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?”* And they stood still, looking sad.  
> 18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, *“Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?”*  
> 19 And He said to them, *“What things?”* And they said to Him, *“The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,*  
> 20 *and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him.*  
> 21 *But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened.*  
> 22 *But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,*  
> 23 *and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.*  
> 24 *Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see.”*  
> 25 *And He said to them, *“O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!*  
> 26 *Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?”*  
> 27 Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.

### John 5:39

> *You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;*

Have you ever noticed when you hear someone speaking from another room, you look towards the voice and if their shadow appears down the hallway you focus on the shadow as the voice continues to speak. But when they enter the room, your eyes turn to the person speaking?

As you can see Jesus testified that all of Scripture points to Him. The people and stories are shadows of the one who is speaking. 

Wouldn't it be nice if
