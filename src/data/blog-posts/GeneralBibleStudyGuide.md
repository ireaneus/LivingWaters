## Discussion Prompts

- When this small group was brought up, what sparked in your mind to attend?  
  - *For me I saw the title "How to study the Bible?" I've had some experience and training, I was curious what training 'Vicky' had on it and if she had the same sources I used?" Fruchtenbaum, A. G.*[^3]
- Is it because of what Pastor Trev said on Sunday? *Read your bibles*
- Is it to learn historical facts and someone's interpretation of the book of Ezekiel?

### Question: Why did you come to this Bible Study?

Imagine you’re walking down the street and someone asks:

> *“Why do you study the Bible?”*

### Scripture for Reflection[^2]

> **Psalm 119:9-18 (NASB1995)**  
> 9. *How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping it according to Your word.* 10. *With all my heart I have sought You; Do not let me wander from Your commandments.* 11. *Your word I have treasured in my heart,That I may not sin against You.* 12. *Blessed are You, O Lord; Teach me Your statutes.* 13. *With my lips I have told of All the ordinances of Your mouth.* 14. *I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, As much as in all riches.* 15. *I will meditate on Your precepts And regard Your ways.* 16. *I shall delight in Your statutes; I shall not forget Your word.* 17. *Deal bountifully with Your servant, That I may live and keep Your word.* 18. *Open my eyes, that I may behold Your Law*[^2]

> **John 5:39 (NASB1995)**  
> *You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me.*[^2]

## What is the Bible truly about, what was it for?

The Bible is God’s inspired Word, revealing His glory in creation—“the heavens declare the glory of God” (Ps 19:1) and fully in His Son, “the radiance of His glory and the exact imprint of His nature” (Heb 1:3; John 1:18). It is given to bear witness to Christ—“these are the Scriptures that testify about Me” (John 5:39)—to make us “wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus” (2 Tim 3:15), to sanctify His people in truth (John 17:17), and to display that “from Him and through Him and to Him are all things” (Rom 11:36). From creation to new creation, it declares Christ crucified, buried, and risen (Isa 53:5–6; 1 Cor 15:3–4), reigning until all things are summed up in Him (Eph 1:10; Rev 21:3–5), that we might know Him, worship Him, and enjoy Him forever.[^4]

## Question: How do we study the Bible

Imagine someone in the group asks:  
> *“What’s the best way to study the Bible so I don’t just read it, but actually understand it?”*

### Pastor Armstrong’s Insight

*“When studying the Bible there is a general practice that uses an inductive technique, which means to allow scripture interpret scripture. The inductive study process involves three steps: observation, interpretation and application. The main tool for each step is the Bible itself, meaning that when there is a question as to a passage's meaning, first look to other scripture to provide the answer.”*[^1]

This approach keeps us grounded in the Word itself rather than in personal opinion.

### A Deeper Foundation: Hermeneutics[^3]

For a much deeper approach, these three principles are founded in the discipline of **Hermeneutics** — the formal study of interpretation. Dr. Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum teaches that proper hermeneutics involves four guiding rules:

1. **The Golden Rule of Interpretation**  
   > *“When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense. Take every word at its primary, ordinary, usual, literal meaning unless the facts of the context indicate otherwise.”*

2. **The Law of Double Reference**  
   - A single passage may describe two different people or events separated by time.  
   - *Example: Isaiah 61:1–2 (fulfilled in part in Luke 4:18–19; awaiting complete fulfillment at Christ’s return).*

3. **The Law of Recurrence**  
   - A passage may recount an event in summary and then repeat it later with more detail.  
   - *Example: Genesis 1 (creation summary) compared with Genesis 2 (details of man and woman).*

4. **The Law of Context**  
   - A verse cannot be lifted out of its context.  
   - *“A text apart from its context becomes a pretext.”*

### Christ-Centered Principle

All true Bible study must remember that the central theme of Scripture is **Jesus Christ**. Hermeneutics provides the guardrails, but Christ is the destination.  

> *“The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed.”*  
> *“The Old is the New contained; the New is the Old explained.”*

> **Luke 24:27 (NASB1995)**  
> *Then beginning with Moses and with all the Prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.*

In this way, **Inductive Study** gives us the process, **Hermeneutics** gives us the rules, and **Christ** gives us the meaning and purpose.

## 1. Observation — *What does it say?*

Observation is about seeing the details of the text accurately before rushing to conclusions.

- Context: How does the passage fit within its chapter, the book, and the Bible as a whole?
- Details: Look for the who, what, when, where, and why; key words, names, places, and Old Testament references. Ask why the author highlights them.
- Background: Note history, culture, and setting. These keep us from dragging the passage into our modern lens before hearing it in its own world.
- Language: Where helpful, dig into Hebrew or Greek words and see how they are used across Scripture.
  - Example: Revelation 1:10 — John was “in the Spirit on the Lord’s day.” Here, “Lord’s” is an adjective, not a noun, describing the type of day such as a 'Lordy' day and not assigning a specific 'day' to the Lord.

Observation lays the foundation — it tells us what is there without yet deciding what it means.

## 2. Interpretation — *What does it mean?*

Interpretation is about discovering the author’s intended meaning based on what we’ve observed. Every passage has only one meaning, rooted in the purpose of the original writer for the original audience.

Author’s Intent: What point was the author actually making? If we skip this, we risk twisting the passage.

- Example: Romans 10:13–15 is often used as a call to evangelism, but in the flow of Romans 9–11 Paul is explaining Israel’s unbelief. To use it otherwise ignores his argument.

> *"for “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.” How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things!”*

Principles of Interpretation:

- Golden Rule: “When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense. Take every word at its primary, ordinary, usual meaning unless the facts of the context indicate otherwise.”
- Law of Context: A verse cannot be lifted out of its setting. “A text apart from its context becomes a pretext.”

*"the proper procedure to interpret the Scriptures is to first exegete the text in its own context and then check related passages and see exactly what the text actually teaches. However, when the text stops, then we must stop too and not engage in speculations as to how the prophecy may or may not be fulfilled. Then, if a current event actually fits exactly into a prophecy, then that prophecy is fulfilled, but not before."*[^3]

## 3. Application — *How does it change me?*

First, application is where the Word moves from the page to our lives. But it’s important to remember that the Holy Spirit is the One who truly applies Scripture to the heart (John MacArthur). Our role is to see the truth faithfully; and let the Spirit bring conviction and transformation.

Second, application should highlight patterns of sin, struggles, or obedience common to all people. This allows us to see ourselves in the text and respond to God’s call.

Finally, while application may feel like the hardest step, it is also the step where teaching becomes exhortation. A faithful study does not end with theory but with a call to live more Christ-like lives. We sow the Word, and the Spirit makes it fruitful.
