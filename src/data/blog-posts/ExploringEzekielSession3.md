## Introduction: The Enduring Glory and the Enduring Word

Last week, we explored Ezekiel Chapter 1 through Chapter 2, verse 5, under the theme *“Through Reverence and Readiness.”*

*The Lord reigns, His glory fills creation, and His Word endures forever. God commissions His servants based on His unchanging authority, measuring faithfulness by obedience, not results.*

We saw how Ezekiel’s encounter with the glory of God brought him to the ground in *reverence, humility,* and how the Spirit lifted him up—*ready to serve.*

### Tonight’s Theme

**“The Enduring Glory and the Enduring Word.”**

*From Genesis to Revelation, everything God does—every act of creation, redemption, and judgment—is ultimately to display His glory and confirm His Word.*

**Isaiah 40:8 (NASB 1995)**
*“The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever.”*

### Looking Back Before Moving Forward

Last week, we left off on somewhat of a cliffhanger and some of the terminology and study methods I mentioned—words like *“Hermeneutics”, Numbers meaning in the Bible”, or “chiastic structure”*—may have raised questions or puzzled looks.

## Understanding the Tools of Bible Study

### 1. Hermeneutics — How We Interpret Scripture

The word Hermeneutics simply means the science and art of interpretation.

It comes from the Greek hermēneuō, meaning *“to explain”* or *“to interpret.”*

When we study Scripture, our goal is to discover what God meant when He spoke through His chosen authors.

Hermeneutics gives us the framework for doing that faithfully:

- We observe what the text says,
- We interpret what it means, and
- We apply how it transforms our lives.

Good hermeneutics always begins with the conviction that Scripture interprets Scripture—that the Bible is its own best commentary.

These next 2 principles are a part of Hermeneutics that are predominant in Scripture

### 2. The Principle of First Mention (or First Instance)

This principle teaches that the first time a subject, symbol, or term appears in Scripture, it establishes its foundational meaning for how it will be used throughout the rest of the Bible.

In other words, God defines His symbols the first time they appear.

- The number 4 first appears with the 4 rivers divided and flowing in 4 directions. Life sustaining creation

- The east first appears in Genesis 3:24, marking man’s separation from God—and later becomes the direction from which God’s glory returns in Ezekiel 43:2–4.

- The cherubim first appear guarding the way to the tree of life (Genesis 3:24) and are later seen upholding the throne of God in Ezekiel 10 and Revelation 4.

### 3. The Principle of Divine Precedence (God’s Precedent)

God never acts inconsistently with Himself.

He establishes patterns—divine precedents—that He repeats throughout Scripture to confirm His truth.

*“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.”*— **Hebrews 13:8**

**1. The Tabernacle on Earth and the Heavenly Tabernacle**

When God gave Moses the design for the tabernacle, He wasn’t simply giving construction blueprints—He was revealing a pattern of heavenly reality.

*“See that you make them after the pattern for them, which was shown to you on the mountain.”* — **Exodus 25:40**

The earthly tabernacle was a shadow of the heavenly one, a physical copy pointing to a greater spiritual truth.

*“They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle.”* — **Hebrews 8:5**

In the New Testament, Christ fulfills this pattern:

*“Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.”* — **Hebrews 9:24**

**2. Ezekiel and John — Two Prophets, One Vision**

Another divine precedent is seen in the parallel callings of Ezekiel and the Apostle John

- Both were exiles—Ezekiel by the River Chebar, John on the Island of Patmos.
- Both were in the Spirit when heaven was opened to them.
- Both saw a throne surrounded by living creatures
- Both were told to write what they saw (Ezek. 43:11; Rev. 1:19).
- Both saw visions of the End of the Age in a most spectacular fashion

In Lesson 2 I described Ezekiel’s vision as the *most breathtaking call narrative in all of Scripture*. That remains true, however it is within the Old Testament. He alone among the Old Testament prophets beheld the mobile throne of God—His glory in motion—revealed not in the Temple, but in exile. Yet his experience set a precedent for the New Testament prophet, John, who centuries later saw the same divine realities when heaven opened before him. Both saw living creatures surrounding the throne, both were commanded to write, and both were entrusted with long-range prophecies that still shape our understanding of God’s redemptive plan.

Thus, my statement that Ezekiel was the only prophet to see such a grand vision should be understood in this way: he was the only Old Testament prophet granted so vast and detailed a revelation of God’s glory in motion. In the New Testament, that same glory reappears to John, confirming the continuity of divine revelation.

### 4. The Hebrew Writing Style — Chiastic Structure

Unlike Western writing, which moves in a straight line (beginning → middle → end), Hebrew thought often moves in a mirrored pattern called a Chiasm (from the Greek letter chi, shaped like an “X”).

A Chiastic Structure presents ideas in a sequence and then repeats them in reverse order, pointing to a central truth in the middle.

For example:

A. God’s Glory Revealed

B. God’s Spirit Moves

C. God Speaks

B’. God’s Spirit Empowers

A’. God’s Glory Confirmed

The center (C) carries the main message—everything else mirrors it.

You’ll often find this pattern throughout the Bible.  The book of Revelation is all a Chiasm, the 7 churches, and even the churches themselves are in the same structure. Understanding it helps us see how God emphasizes truth through structure, not just words.

## Ezekiel Chapter 2:6-3:11

There’s an old joke – one I’m sure you’ve heard before – of a man who wakes up one Sunday morning and declares to his wife that he’s not going to church

The wife asks, *“Why aren’t you going to church?”* The husband replies, *“Because no likes me. Everyone says unkind things about me behind my back. Whenever I try to join a group of people, they all stop talking and walk away. Plus, the sermons are boring."*

The wife replies kindly, *“Oh son, you must go to church.”* The husband asks, *“Why do I have to go?”* And the wife answers, *“Because you’re the pastor.”*

### Ezekiel 2:6–7 — Called to Speak, Whether They Listen or Not

> **Ezekiel 2:6–7 (NASB 1995)**  
> “And you, *son of man*, neither *fear them* nor *fear their words*, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither *fear* their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house.  
> But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.”

- Second time God calls Ezekiel *"son of man"*
- three times God says, *“Do not fear.”* (in verse 6 alone)
- Second time *whether they listen or not*

> **Matthew 23:37**
> *"“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling."*
> 
> **Proverbs 29:25** — “The fear of man brings a snare,  
> But he who trusts in the LORD will be exalted.”  

**Question:**

> *What is God trying to say to us? If He is repeating Himself there is a reason.*
