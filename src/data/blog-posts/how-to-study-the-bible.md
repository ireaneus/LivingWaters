## Purpose of Bible Study

The goal of Bible study is not simply knowledge, but transformation. The Bible reveals God's will and redemptive plan and calls believers to align with His truth. As Jesus said:

> **John 17:17**  
> "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth." (NASB1995)

## Core Principles of Interpretation

### 1. Observation

- What does the text say?
- Consider terms, structure, and literary forms (historical, poetic, prophetic).[^1][^2]

### 2. Interpretation

- What did the passage mean to the original audience?
- Evaluate genre, historical background, and authorial intent.

### 3. Evaluation and Application

- Discern which truths are timeless and which were specific to a time or covenant.
- Apply the passage appropriately in today’s context.

### 4. Correlation

- How does this passage align with the rest of Scripture?
- Scripture must harmonize with Scripture.

> **2 Timothy 3:16–17**  
> "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work." (NASB1995)

## Four Rules of Hermeneutics

### 1. Golden Rule of Interpretation

“When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense.” Take each word in its literal, ordinary meaning unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

### 2. Law of Double Reference

One passage may refer to two distinct events or persons separated in time.

- **Isaiah 61:1–2** — fulfilled in part in **Luke 4:18–19**.
- **Zechariah 9:9–10** — Christ’s first and second coming.

### 3. Law of Recurrence

A later passage recounts the same event with additional details.

- **Genesis 1:26–27** / **Genesis 2:7–25** — creation of man.
- **Ezekiel 38–39** — judgment of Gog and Magog.

### 4. Law of Context

“A text apart from its context is a pretext.” Always interpret verses within their immediate and extended context.

## New Testament Use of Old Testament

The New Testament writers quote the Hebrew Scriptures in four primary ways:

### 1. Literal Prophecy + Literal Fulfillment

- **Matthew 2:5–6** quotes **Micah 5:2** — birthplace of Messiah.
- **Matthew 1:22–23** quotes **Isaiah 7:14** — virgin birth.

### 2. Literal + Typology

- **Matthew 2:15** quotes **Hosea 11:1** — Israel as a type of Christ.
- **John 19:36** quotes **Exodus 12:46** — no bones broken in the Passover lamb.
- **Book of Hebrews** — draws deeply from Levitical types.

### 3. Literal + Application

- **Matthew 2:17–18** quotes **Jeremiah 31:15** — sorrow at the slaughter of infants.
- **Acts 2:16–21** quotes **Joel 2:28–32** — partially fulfilled at Pentecost.

### 4. Summation of Prophetic Themes

- **Matthew 2:23**, **Luke 18:31–33**, **Matthew 26:54–56** — “spoken by the prophets.”

## Messianic Prophecy

Messianic prophecies in the Old Testament are fulfilled across four categories:

### 1. First Coming Only

- **Isaiah 53:1–12** — suffering servant.
- **Micah 5:2** — Bethlehem birth.

### 2. Second Coming Only

- **Isaiah 63:1–6** — judgment at the second advent.
- **Zechariah 14:1–9** — Messiah’s reign from Jerusalem.

### 3. Blended First and Second Coming

- **Zechariah 9:9–10** — humility followed by universal reign.
- **Isaiah 61:1–2** — liberty and vengeance.

### 4. Entire Redemptive Career

- **Psalm 22**, **Psalm 110**, **Daniel 7:13–14** — suffering, exaltation, rule.

## Interpretive Examples

> **Luke 24:27**  
> "Then beginning with Moses and with all the Prophets, He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures." (NASB1995)

> **Acts 17:2–3**  
> "And according to Paul’s custom, he visited them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and giving evidence that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead." (NASB1995)

> **Acts 18:28**  
> "For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ." (NASB1995)
