## Introduction

In Chapter 19 we read of Christ's climactic return to earth, accompanied by His Bride, the Church saints. Christ defeats the Antichrist and his forces, slaying all who have the mark of the beast and casting the Antichrist and the False Prophet into the lake of fire. Chapter 19 is a summary of Christ's return from a heavenly viewpoint, but for the details on how things unfold on earth, and Satan's battle strategies before his ultimate demise, we look back to the Old Testament prophets.

## Chapter 19 - The Coming of Christ

> 11. *"And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.*  
> 12. *His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.*  
> 13. *He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.*  
> 14. *And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.*  
> 15. *From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.*  
> 16. *And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND Lord OF LORDS.”*  
> 17. *Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, “Come, assemble for the great supper of God,*  
> 18. *so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great.”*  
> 19. *And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army."*

Our last study ended with the **Saving of Israel**, when God turns His covenant people back to Himself. 

But before Christ appears from glory, Scripture shows the **Antichrist’s final move**: gathering his armies against Jerusalem. The prophets describe this conflict in striking detail.

## Antichrist’s Position Between the Seas and the Holy Mountain

> **Daniel 11:45** – *“He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.”*

* “The seas” = the **Mediterranean (Great Sea)**.
* “The beautiful holy mountain” = **Mount Zion/Jerusalem**.
* This places the Antichrist’s headquarters directly **west of Jerusalem**, preparing for his final assault.

## Stage III - The Siege of Jerusalem

> **Zechariah 12:2** – *“Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes staggering to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.”*  
> **Zechariah 14:2** – *“For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be taken…”*  
> **Luke 21:20** – *“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is near.”*

* The Antichrist gathers **all nations** for one final push.
* Jerusalem is surrounded, and the city suffers greatly.
* Yet God promises that the **siege will not be complete**, for Christ Himself will intervene.

## Warfare in the Last Days

With the devastation of the Tribulation, technology is broken down and **warfare returns to a primitive style**. Prophets describe it with **horses, siege ramps, and swords**:

* **Isaiah 29:3** – *“I will camp against you encircling you, and I will set siegeworks against you, and I will raise up battle towers against you.”*
* **Ezekiel 4:2** – *“Lay siege… build a siege wall, raise up a ramp, pitch camps, and place battering rams against it all around.”*
* **Ezekiel 38:4** – *“I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them magnificently dressed…”*
* **Zechariah 14:15** – *"So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps."*.
* **Revelation 19:18** – speaks of the “flesh of horses and of those who sit on them,” confirming **cavalry imagery** at Armageddon.

This demonstrates the **literal fulfillment** of Old Testament prophecies of siege warfare.

## Jerusalem’s Walls and God’s Protection

Even in this last battle, the **ancient walls of Jerusalem** play a defensive role:

* **Lamentations 2:8-9** – *“The Lord determined to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion… Her gates have sunk into the ground.”*
* **Nahum 3:13** – *“…the gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies.”*
* **Zechariah 2:5** – *“I will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.”*

Though **stone walls provide temporary defense**, the **true protection of Israel is the Lord Himself**.

The Antichrist and his forces, sitting in northern Israel, have heard of the destruction of their capital Babylon. Furious and with only one play left, he presses southward to annihilate the Jews in Jerusalem and instructs any surviving forces in Babylon to head to Petra (Bozrah) and do likewise to the Jews there.

**Daniel 11:40-45**

> 40. *"At the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with **chariots, with horsemen and with many ships**; and he will enter countries, overflow them and pass through.*  
> 41. *He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon.*  
> 42. *Then he will stretch out his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.*  
> 43. *But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels.*  
> 44. *But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many.*  
> 45. *He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him."*

**Daniel 11:45** tells us that the Antichrist's army eventually reach a point between the Great Sea and the Holy Mountain, and from there they advance east to Jerusalem, surrounding the city and sieging it. Because the Tribulation has reduced society to a rudimentary level of technology, warfare returns to a medieval style. Zechariah and other Old Testament prophets tell us the Antichrist uses siege ramps, horses and swords. For a similar reason, the Jews in Jerusalem are protected, to some extent, by the walls of the city.

Jesus had already set the terms for His Second Coming for His people. As we read in Luke 13, they must call out for Him as their Messiah.

**Luke 13:34-35**

> 34. *"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it!*  
> 35. *"Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ”*

God permits this attack on Jerusalem, as it is ultimately designed to bring the Jews to repentance. Zechariah describes the assault as follows:

**Zech. 14:2-5**

> 2. *"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.*
> 3. *Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.*
> 4. *In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.*
> 5. *You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!"*

Hosea 6 tells us that the battle would go on for two days, and then on the third day the nation of Israel would be brought to faith by the Spirit, and as they respond by calling out on Jesus, He comes to them. This is not a rigid countdown but a prophetic picture of a **short time of distress followed by sudden revival and deliverance**.

## Stage IV - Jesus Descends on Petra

Christ's glorious return to earth isn't a singular moment resulting in the immediate annihilation of His enemies. It's a carefully scripted and foretold sequence of events that spans a number of days. Revelation gives us the heavenly overview, while the Old Testament prophets supply the **earthly details stretched across those days**.

In Isaiah 34, the Lord describes His sword as being ready to descend and to destroy the nations. His sword is filled with blood, and first on the agenda is a specific group He has devoted to destruction - *"For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom."* - **Isa. 34:6**

### Bozrah/Petra in Prophecy

Part of the Antichrist's forces have arrived in Petra (Bozrah) intent on hunting down the Jews in hiding. But little do they know that they are the prepared sacrifice, whose blood will stain the mountains. In Rev. 19, Jesus descends with His army behind, but He alone does the fighting and as He arrives in Petra, all those that sought to kill His people are annihilated.

### The Hiding Place of the Remnant

> **Revelation 12:6, 14** – *“Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared by God… she was nourished for a time, times, and half a time.”*

> **Micah 2:12** – *“I will certainly assemble all of you, Jacob… like sheep in the fold.”*

* The “woman” = Israel.
* God provides a **prepared place** of safety.
* Micah hints at a **sheepfold** (Petra = natural rock fortress).

---

### The Antichrist’s Pursuit

> **Jeremiah 49:13** – *“…Bozrah will become an object of horror, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse.”*

* Bozrah = capital city of Edom, often linked with Petra.
* Antichrist’s forces move in to crush the Jewish remnant.
* Instead of victory, **they become the target of God’s wrath**.

---

### The Sacrifice in Bozrah

> **Isaiah 34:5-6** – *“The Lord has a sword… for the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.”*

> **Isaiah 34:3** – *“…the mountains will be drenched with their blood.”*

* The armies are described as a **sacrifice** offered up by God.
* Their blood stains the mountains around Petra.

---

### Christ Descends as the Warrior-King

> **Revelation 19:11, 14-15** – *“Heaven opened… the One called Faithful and True… the armies of heaven followed Him… From His mouth comes a sharp sword…”*

> **Isaiah 63:3, 5** – *“I have trodden the wine trough alone… I looked, but there was no one to help; so My own arm brought salvation to Me.”*

* Jesus returns **with His armies behind Him**.
* Yet **He fights alone** — salvation is His work.
* His garments are stained with the blood of judgment.

---

### The Annihilation of the Enemy

> **Zechariah 14:3** – *“Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.”*

> **Habakkuk 3:12-13** – *“In indignation You marched through the earth… You went forth for the salvation of Your people.”*

> **Revelation 19:21** – *“The rest were killed with the sword… and all the birds were filled with their flesh.”*

* Complete destruction of the Antichrist’s armies at Bozrah/Petra.
* The **remnant is delivered**, fulfilling God’s covenant promises.

### Jesus releases the Remnant in Petra

Now Micah tells us what Jesus does next:

**Micah 2:12-13**

> 12. *“I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with men."*
> 13. *"The breaker goes up before them; They break out, pass through the gate and go out by it. So their king goes on before them, And the Lord at their head.”*

This is a description of the remnant being released from their place of protection and provision at the end of the Tribulation. Jesus defeats those attacking the remnant and then He opens the gate and leads them out. But where does He lead the Exodus-like group to? Isaiah, in his vision as he's standing on the walls of Jerusalem while the Antichrist is attacking the city, gives us the answer. As the wall crumbles around him, flames enrage and screams are heard, he looks into the distance and asks:

**Isaiah 63:1-2**

> 1. *"Who is this who comes from Edom, With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah, This One who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the greatness of His strength? “It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”*
> 2. *"Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?"*

Isaiah sees Jesus heading towards Jerusalem coming from Bozrah within Edom. His clothes are red from the blood of battle He just fought at Bozrah. So Jesus leads the remnant from Bozrah to Jerusalem and as He approaches the city, it is being attacked by all of the Antichrist's remaining forces.
