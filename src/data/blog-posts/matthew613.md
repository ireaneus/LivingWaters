**Spare me from the kind of test that would expose my weakness**

**vs. 24** No one can serve two masters
Cannot serve God and wealth
**vs. 25** Do not be worried about your life —
Eat, drink, clothes
**vs. 26** Birds soul, range, gather, heavenly Father feeds them — much more important

**vs. 33** Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, all these will be provided

**vs. 34** Do not worry about tomorrow — each day has enough trouble

**Temptation = test** — not always a solicitation to do evil
Greater than we bear → **1 Corinthians 10:13**
God does not tempt men to do evil → **James 1:13**
Praying that we know our weakness — we would be spared exposure to it

## How to Pray

- *Abba Father*
- Pray to the Father, Christ intercedes
- Your name, kingdom, and will top priority — glory and agenda
- Our daily provisions, our needs not our greeds
- Confessing our transgressions, and forgiving others
- Don't allow the trials and testing expose our weaknesses so that we might fail
  - 1 Corinthians 15:12-13
  - James 1:3,12-13
  - Psalm 19:13

> *"And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil."*  
> —**Matthew 6:13**

> *"Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, 3knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 4And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."*  
> —**James 1:2-3**

> *"Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. 14But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust."*  
> —**James 1:13-14** the birth of sin

> *"Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins;*  
> *Let them not rule over me;*  
> *Then I will be blameless,*  
> *And I shall be acquitted of great transgression."*  
> — Psalm 19:13

> *"Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall. 13No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it."*  
> —**1 Corinthians 15:12-13** OT examples previous verses

> **"The man who prays ‘Lead us not’ then goes into it is a liar before God — it is shameful profanity when it comes from lips of men who resort to places of amusement whose moral tone is bad."**
> — *Spurgeon*
