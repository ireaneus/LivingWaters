## Why This Matters

It is easy, especially after studying weak or unbiblical theories of the atonement, to become dismissive or irritated. Some modern theories can sound shallow, man-centered, or logically inconsistent. However, Scripture calls us not only to defend truth, but to do so with humility and gentleness.

- *“Contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints.”* (**Jude 1:3**)  
- *“The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome… correcting those who are in opposition with gentleness.”* (**2 Timothy 2:24–25**)  
- *“Speaking the truth in love.”* (**Ephesians 4:15**)  

Truth matters. But tone matters too.

## A Short Personal Discipline Before Speaking

### 1️⃣ Pause — Remember Who Opened Your Eyes

Pray:

> “Lord, if I understand anything rightly, it is because You showed me.”

- *“What do you have that you did not receive?”* (**1 Corinthians 4:7**)  
- *“By the grace of God I am what I am.”* (**1 Corinthians 15:10**)  

This kills pride immediately.

---

### 2️⃣ Re-center — My Goal Is Not to Win

Pray:

> “My goal is not to win an argument, but to honor Christ.”

- *“Let all that you do be done in love.”* (**1 Corinthians 16:14**)  
- *“Speaking the truth in love.”* (**Ephesians 4:15**)  

Winning arguments is flesh. Winning souls is spiritual.

---

### 3️⃣ Ask for the Right Spirit

Pray:

> “Give me firmness without harshness.”

- *“The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome… correcting with gentleness.”* (**2 Timothy 2:24–25**)  
- *“Let your speech always be with grace.”* (**Colossians 4:6**)  

Gentleness is controlled strength.

---

### 4️⃣ Stay Anchored in Scripture

Commit beforehand:

- I will argue from Scripture.  
- I will avoid sarcasm.  
- I will avoid labeling.  
- I will avoid dismissive tone.  

If I find myself thinking,  
“This is just nonsense,”  
that is my cue to slow down.

---

### 5️⃣ Remember What Sovereign Grace Produces

If I believe:

- Salvation is sovereign  
- Hearts are changed by the Spirit  
- Eyes are opened by God  

Then I do not need to force anything.

- *“The anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.”* (**James 1:20**)  

Calm theology should produce calm demeanor.

## A 30-Second Prayer Before Conversations

> “Father, You opened my eyes by grace. Guard me from pride. Let me defend truth without harshness. Help me love the person in front of me more than I love being right. Make my words clear, biblical, and gentle. I trust You to change hearts. Amen.”

## A Conversation Template for Real-Life Discussions

When someone says:

> “Everyone has the ability to choose God.”

Instead of correcting immediately, use this pattern:

### Step 1 — Clarify

“Help me understand what you mean by ability. Do you mean moral ability, spiritual ability, or opportunity?”

### Step 2 — Affirm What You Can

“I agree that everyone is responsible to repent and believe.”

(Responsibility does not equal ability.)

### Step 3 — Gently Introduce Scripture

“How do you understand this verse?”

- *“The mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so.”* (**Romans 8:7**)  
- *“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him.”* (**John 6:44**)  

Let Scripture do the heavy lifting.

### Step 4 — Keep It Relational

“I’m not trying to argue — I genuinely want to understand how you reconcile that.”

Tone determines whether the conversation continues.

### Step 5 — Leave Room for the Spirit

You do not have to close the case.

You can say:

“That’s something I’ve wrestled with for a long time. I’d encourage you to meditate on those passages.”

Trust God to work.

## Final Reminder

The doctrines of grace should produce:

- Humility  
- Patience  
- Gentleness  
- Confidence in God  

If they produce arrogance, something has gone wrong in the heart.

Strong doctrine.  
Soft tone.  
Firm convictions.  
Gentle spirit.  

That combination reflects Christ.
