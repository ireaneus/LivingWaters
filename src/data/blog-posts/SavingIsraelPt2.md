## Stage V - Jesus Arrives at Jerusalem

Hosea describes the Antichrist's attack on Jerusalem as a time of distress which brings the surviving Jews there to finally acknowledge that Christ is Lord. Upon their confession, Jesus returns and saves them on the third day.

**Hosea 5:15-6:2**

> 15. *"I will go away and return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me."*
> 16. *"Come, let us return to the Lord. For He has torn us, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bandage us."*
> 17. *"He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him."*

**Zech 14:3-5**

> 3. *"Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.*  
> 4. *In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.*  
> 5. *You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!"*

## Jesus reaches Jerusalem

When Jesus reaches Jerusalem, the Antichrist's forces have already been attacking the city from the west for three days. God has been supernaturally limiting the success of the invasion, using the event to bring the remaining Jews there to repentance. On the third day of battle, Jesus arrives, standing on the Mount of Olives on the east of Jerusalem.

Zechariah tells us that Jesus will change the geography, splitting the Mount of Olives into two, creating a valley and an escape route for the surviving Jews in Jerusalem. Once His people are safely out of the city, Jesus, through his spoken Word, will destroy the Antichrist and all his forces.

**2 Thess. 2:8**

> *"Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay **with the breath of His mouth** and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;"*

**Heb. 4:12**

> *"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart."*

## By the Word of His Power

Jesus' word is more than enough to destroy anything, because it's the only thing holding everything together. It was His word that spoke Creation into existence. So at the word of Christ, the Antichrist is struck down, his armies perish in the same moment, and the battle is over quickly. The War of Armageddon, the Age of the Gentiles, and the Tribulation come to an end. Finally, the earth is at rest from war.

This is consistent with Revelation’s **heavenly overview** and the prophets’ **earthly detail**: what looks instantaneous from heaven unfolds over a short but intense span on earth.

### **1. Jesus’ word is enough to destroy anything**

* **Hebrews 4:12** – *“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword…”*
* **Revelation 19:15** – *“From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations…”*

### **2. His word holds everything together**

* **Colossians 1:16–17** – *“All things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.”*
* **Hebrews 1:3** – *“…He upholds all things by the word of His power.”*

### **3. His word spoke Creation into existence**

* **Genesis 1:3** – *“Then God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light.”*
* **John 1:1, 3** – *“In the beginning was the Word… All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.”*

### **4. Antichrist destroyed by Christ’s word**

* **2 Thessalonians 2:8** – *“Then that lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will eliminate with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming.”*
* **Isaiah 11:4** – *“…He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.”*

### **5. His armies perish the same way / battle over quickly**

* **Revelation 19:21** – *“And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.”*
* **Zechariah 14:12** – *“Now this will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.”*

### **6. Armageddon, Age of the Gentiles, Tribulation end**

* **Revelation 19:19** – *“And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse, and against His army.”*
* **Daniel 2:44** – *“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed… it will put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever.”*

### **7. The earth finally at rest from war**

* **Isaiah 2:4** – *“Nation will not lift up sword against nation, and never again will they learn war.”*
* **Micah 4:3–4** – *“They will hammer their swords into plowshares… each of them will sit under his vine and under his fig tree, with no one to make them afraid.”*

## The demise of the Antichrist

Read Habakkuk 3:3-13 which is a prophecy of Christ's return to Jerusalem. It describes God coming from Teman, which was a district within Edom. The name Teman was also a synonym for "South". The demise of the Antichrist is described in v13, where Christ strikes him and lays him open from neck to thigh.

**Habakkuk 3:3-13**

> 3. "God comes from Teman,  
> And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah.  
> His splendor covers the heavens,  
> And the earth is full of His praise.  
> 4. His radiance is like the sunlight;  
> He has rays flashing from His hand,  
> And there is the hiding of His power.  
> 5. Before Him goes pestilence,  
> And plague comes after Him.  
> 6. He stood and surveyed the earth;  
> He looked and startled the nations.  
> Yes, the perpetual mountains were shattered,  
> The ancient hills collapsed.  
> His ways are everlasting.  
> 7. I saw the tents of Cushan under distress,  
> The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling.  
> 8. Did the Lord rage against the rivers,  
> Or was Your anger against the rivers,  
> Or was Your wrath against the sea,  
> That You rode on Your horses,  
> On Your chariots of salvation?  
> 9. Your bow was made bare,  
> The rods of chastisement were sworn. Selah.  
> You cleaved the earth with rivers.  
> 10. The mountains saw You and quaked;  
> The downpour of waters swept by.  
> The deep uttered forth its voice,  
> It lifted high its hands.  
> 11. Sun and moon stood in their places;  
> They went away at the light of Your arrows,  
> At the radiance of Your gleaming spear.  
> 12. In indignation You marched through the earth;  
> In anger You trampled the nations.  
> 13. You went forth for the salvation of Your people,  
> For the salvation of Your anointed.  
> You struck the head of the house of the evil  
> To lay him open from thigh to neck. Selah."  

## The End of the Age

All opposing armies have been destroyed and a large group of Jews on earth have been saved. There will also be some believing Gentiles on earth at Jesus' coming and unbelieving Gentiles who weren't part of the army, and who survived the Tribulation. We'll soon discover what happens to all surviving humans as we transition into the thousand year Kingdom period. But before that period can begin, there is a lot of cleaning up to do as the world has been totally devastated during the Tribulation and in need of serious rebuilding.

**Revelation 20:1-4** – Satan bound, saints reign 1,000 years.  
**Isaiah 11:6-9** – peace in creation, wolf and lamb dwell together.  
**Ezekiel 39:9-12** – post-battle cleanup, burning weapons for seven years.
