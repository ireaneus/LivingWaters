## Irresistible Grace TULIP

**_Irresistible grace_** is a theological concept within Reformed theology that describes the effective and sovereign work of God’s grace in bringing the elect to salvation. It teaches that when God calls a person to salvation through His grace, this calling cannot ultimately be resisted because it is a work of God’s will and power, not dependent on human effort or will.  

This doctrine is part of the "Five Points of Calvinism" (TULIP) and corresponds to the "I" in the acronym.

## Key Aspects of Irresistible Grace

1. Effectual Calling:  

_Irresistible grace refers to God’s effectual call, distinct from the general call of the gospel. The general call is extended to all who hear the message, but the effectual call guarantees that the elect will respond in repentance and faith. This is rooted in Romans 8:30: "And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified."_  

1. Monergistic Work:  

_Irresistible grace emphasizes that salvation is solely the work of God (monergism), not a cooperative effort between God and humanity. Left to their own sinful nature, humans cannot choose God, but His grace overcomes their resistance._  

1. Transforming the Will:  

_God’s grace does not override or coerce the human will; rather, it transforms the heart and inclines the will toward God. This is illustrated in Ezekiel 36:26-27: "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."_  

1. A Work of the Holy Spirit:  

_Irresistible grace is the action of the Holy Spirit, regenerating and drawing the elect to salvation. This aligns with John 6:37: "All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out."_  

## Biblical Support for Irresistible Grace

- **_John 6:44:_** _"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day."_

- **_John 6:65:_** _And He was saying, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.”_

- **_Luke 1:68:_** _"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,"_
- **_Philippians 2:13:_** _"For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure."_

- **_Acts 16:14:_** "The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul."
- **_Romans 8:_**
- **_Ephesians 1&2_**

## Theological Perspectives

1. Reformed View:  

_Irresistible grace ensures that all whom God has chosen and predestined for salvation will come to Him. It does not mean that individuals never resist God’s grace at any point in their lives, but that God’s grace will ultimately overcome their resistance._  

2. Critics (e.g., Arminian View):  
_Arminians reject irresistible grace, arguing that God’s grace can be resisted because He respects human free will. They uphold the concept of prevenient grace, which enables a person to respond to God’s call but does not guarantee it._

## Illustrative Summary

**_Irresistible grace_** can be likened to a loving shepherd rescuing a lost sheep. The sheep may initially resist or wander, but the shepherd’s care and guidance ensure that the sheep is safely brought back to the fold. Similarly, God’s grace effectively calls and transforms His elect, ensuring their salvation.

# Prevenient Grace

**Prevenient Grace** is a theological term used to describe the grace of God that precedes human decision and enables the sinner to respond to His offer of salvation. This grace is often associated with God's initiating work in salvation, softening the heart and drawing individuals to Him. While the term itself is not directly found in Scripture, its concept is reflected in several biblical passages.

### Key Aspects of Prevenient Grace

1. **God’s Initiative in Salvation**  
   Prevenient grace highlights that salvation begins with God, not human effort.  
   - _John 6:44_: "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day."
   - _Philippians 2:13_: "For it is God who is at work in you, both to desire and to work for His good pleasure."

2. **Enabling Response to the Gospel**  
   This grace is understood as God's work in enabling the spiritually dead sinner to respond to the gospel.  
   - _Ephesians 2:4-5_: "But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)."
   - _Romans 2:4_: "Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and restraint and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?"

3. **The Universal Aspect of Grace**  
   Prevenient grace is often seen as universally available, giving every person the opportunity to respond to God.  
   - _Titus 2:11_: "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people."
   - _John 12:32_: "And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself."

4. **Conviction of Sin**  
   The Holy Spirit’s role in convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment is an expression of prevenient grace.  
   - _John 16:8_: "And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment."

### Summary

Prevenient grace demonstrates God’s proactive love and mercy, breaking through human inability and spiritual deadness to make salvation _possible_. It aligns with passages like _Romans 5:8_—"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"—underscoring that God always takes the first step toward humanity. This grace is not irresistible but works to enable the free choice to accept or reject the gospel.

Prevenient grace, therefore, is the foundation of God's redemptive work, ensuring that salvation remains an act of divine initiative and grace from start to finish (_Ephesians 2:8-9_).
