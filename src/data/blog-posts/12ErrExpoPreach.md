## 12 Erroneous Expository Preaching Methods

The following are Erroneous Expository Preaching Methods — approaches that call themselves “expository preaching,” yet fail to meet the biblical standard demonstrated in Nehemiah 8:8, Luke 24:27, Acts 2, Acts 17, 1 Timothy 4:13, and 2 Timothy 4:1–5.

These methods appear *“conservative,”* *“biblical,”* or even *“deep”* — but they subvert the God-ordained nature and purpose of preaching.

These are not merely less ideal. They are unfaithful, unbiblical substitutes for true exposition.

### Scripture References

> **Nehemiah 8:8** *"They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading."*  
> **Luke 24:27** *"Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures."*  
> **Acts 2:14-36**  
> **Acts 17:2-3** *"And according to Paul’s custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.”*  
> **Acts 17:11** *"Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so."*  
> **1 Timothy 4:13** *Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching.*  
> **2 Timothy 4:1-5** *I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.*  

## 1. The Running Commentary Sermon

*(“Verse by verse” but not actually expository)*

This looks expository because the pastor moves through a passage line by line.

But the sermon is:

- descriptive, not doctrinal
- factual, not theological
- informational, not confrontational
- commentary, not proclamation

> This method never pierces the conscience, never demands repentance, and never exalts Christ from the text. It is a lecture, not preaching.

## 2. The Word-Study Sermon

*(Grammar replaces doctrine)*

- “This verb is in the aorist passive…”
- “Let me give you the Greek roots…”
- “Here are seven meanings of this word…”

> A sermon drowning in linguistics is not exposition. Linguistic observation is a tool, not the meal. When it becomes the substance, it is a counterfeit.

## 3. The Historical-Cultural Sermon

*(Background overwhelms the Bible)*

The pastor spends:

- 20 minutes on archaeology
- 15 minutes on ancient customs
- 10 minutes on Greco-Roman politics

And then sprinkles one spiritual point at the end.

> History is good. History as the sermon is idolatry of scholarship. Biblical exposition is about the text, not the world around the text.

## 4. The “Bible-Flavored” Topical Sermon

  (Uses verses as seasoning)*

The pastor chooses a topic first—then finds “supporting verses” taken out of context.

The sermon sounds biblical because many verses are quoted.

- But none of them are explained.
- None are rooted in context.
- None drive the sermon.

> This is error of method, even if the content is orthodox.

## 5. The Application-Only Sermon

*(Moralizing without meaning)*

The pastor jumps straight to:

*“Here’s how you can improve your marriage.”* *“Here’s how to overcome fear.”*

- No doctrinal foundation.
- No Christ.
- No redemptive-historical framework.
- No explanation of the text’s meaning.

> This is Christianized self-help, not preaching.

## 6. The Doctrine-Removed Sermon

*(Aimed at comfort, avoids theological clarity)*

Doctrine is:

- “too divisive”
- “too academic”
- “not what people need today”

This is a pastoral betrayal.

Paul commands:
*“Teach what accords with sound doctrine.” (Titus 2:1)*

> No doctrine = no exposition.

## 7. The Christless Sermon

*(Uses Scripture without pointing to Christ)*

A sermon can be:

- verse-by-verse
- expositional in form
- doctrinally informative
- …and still be Christless.

> If Christ is not shown as the *fulfillment and center (Luke 24:27)*, it is not preaching — it is Judaism.

## 8. The All-Application, No-Repentance Sermon

*(Practical, motivational, safe)*

The pastor applies the text to:

- emotional struggles
- daily routines
- life habits

…but avoids:

- naming sin
- confronting the conscience
- demanding repentance
- issuing warnings of judgment
- calling for obedience

> This violates *2 Timothy 4:2*.
> *"preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction."*

## 9. The Emotional-Bath Sermon

*(Storytelling replaces Scripture)*

The pastor spends half the sermon:

- telling stories
- sharing experiences
- building emotional flow
- narrating illustrations

> …and the text becomes a mere prop. This is entertainment wearing a biblical mask.

## 10. The “Wikipedia Sermon”

*(Information dump with no theological spine)*

This sermon piles:

- trivia
- facts
- definitions
- details
- data

But lacks:

- doctrine
- Christ
- confrontation
- Spirit-wrought urgency

> This sermon may impress—but it cannot sanctify.

## 11. The Detached Academic Sermon

*(Preaching that sounds like a seminary lecture)*

This turns the pulpit into a classroom:

- calm
- unemotional
- detached
- analytical
- informational

> Paul commands heralding, not lecturing. Preaching is proclamation, not presentation.

## 12. The “Meaningless Exposition” Sermon

*(All explanation — no application)*

The sermon rightly explains:

- context
- syntax
- structure
- meaning

But never says:

- “Therefore…”
- “Thus says the Lord…”
- “Repent…”
- “Believe…”
- “Obey…”
- “Examine yourselves…”

> Application is not a bonus.  
> Application is a biblical mandate.  
>
> Without application, the sermon is not complete and not expository.

## SUMMARY: THE CORE COUNTERFEIT

*All twelve counterfeits share one fatal error: They treat preaching as INFORMATION. But Scripture treats preaching as TRANSFORMATION.*

God commands sermons to:

- expose sin
- demand repentance
- proclaim Christ
- teach doctrine
- confront the conscience
- strengthen the saints
- warn the rebellious
- produce obedience
- glorify God

> Any method that avoids these elements—no matter how “expository” it pretends to be—is a counterfeit.
