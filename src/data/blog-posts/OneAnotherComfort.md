### 💬 Discussion Question

> When was the last time somebody acted like your angel and truly encouraged or comforted you? Maybe they prayed 🙏 for you, truly listened to you, spoke words of life that made a difference in your walk with the Lord.

### 🌿 Personal Reflection to Open the Study

As I was thinking, and working on this study on *encourage and comfort one another*, I realized — we recently  experienced that kind of *“one another”* moment.  

When Nan and I left this last church because of doctrinal issues, it was another hard moment in our lives. We were just beginning to build relationships with some of them, we were being prayed for, and praying with them, we thought we arrived.

But there were close friends who came alongside us. They prayed with us, listened patiently, and gently reminded us of the truth. They didn’t try to fix everything — they helped us see what God was already revealing.

That kind of encouragement — truth spoken in love — gave us the courage to take the step we needed to take, and now we are attending Crossings - And bringing the friends who encouraged us along for the ride.

I think through this study tonight we’re going to see what it really means to be an encourager and a comforter for one another — and what that looks like for our church and this small group.

I’ve shared one example of what it meant for someone to come alongside us and bring comfort when we were hurting.

## 1. Opening Reading (10 min)

Begin the study by reading **1 Thessalonians 4:13–5:11** aloud.  
Paul wrote these words to believers who were grieving the loss of loved ones and fearful about Christ’s return.  
Twice, he gives the same instruction:

> **1 Thessalonians 4:18** — “Therefore comfort one another with these words.”  
> **1 Thessalonians 5:11** — “Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.”

These verses set the tone: Christian encouragement and comfort are anchored in the *truth of the gospel and the hope of resurrection* — not in vague positivity.

## 2. Word Study — What the Bible Means by “Encourage” and “Comfort” (15 min)

### 💬 Encourage — Greek: **παρακαλέω (*parakaleō*)**

- Root meaning: “to call alongside,” “to urge,” “to strengthen,” or “to comfort.”  
- Used over 100 times in the New Testament.  
- Related noun: **παράκλητος (*paraklētos*)**, “Helper” or “Advocate,” used for the Holy Spirit (*John 14:26*).  

**How the Bible describes encouragement:**

1. **Coming alongside someone with truth** — reminding them of God’s promises. (*1 Thess 5:11; Hebrews 3:13*)  
2. **Strengthening the fainthearted** — urging endurance, not mere sympathy. (*1 Thess 5:14; Acts 14:22*)  
3. **Pointing others toward hope** — especially when weary or suffering. (*Romans 15:4–5*)  

> **Romans 15:4–5 (NASB1995)**  
> *“For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus.”*

Encouragement, then, is **truth-based strengthening** — helping someone stand firm in faith through the promises of God.

### 💗 Comfort — Greek: **παραμυθέομαι (*paramytheomai*)**

- Meaning: “to console,” “to speak gently,” “to calm,” or “to soothe with compassion.”  
- More tender than *parakaleō*; emphasizes **empathy and personal care**.  
- Found in *1 Thess 4:18* and *John 11:19–31* (where mourners comfort Mary and Martha).  

**How the Bible describes comfort:**

1. **Meeting sorrow with the hope of truth** — comforting the grieving with eternal perspective. (*1 Thess 4:18*)  
2. **Compassion that reflects God’s own comfort** — we share the same comfort we have received from Him.  
   > **2 Corinthians 1:3–4 (NASB1995)**  
   > *“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.”*  
3. **Gentle reassurance** — comfort is not escape from pain but the presence of peace within it.

Biblical comfort is **Spirit-led compassion rooted in divine truth** — not avoiding pain, but helping others see God’s hand in it.

## 3. Exploring Other Encourage & Comfort Verses (20 min)

> **Romans 12:15-16** *“Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.”*

> **Romans 15:1-2,5** *““Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves. Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification.”Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ”*

> **Hebrews 3:13** *“But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.”*

> **Hebrews 10:24–25** *“and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.”*

> **2 Corinthians 13:11** *“Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.”*

> **James 5:13–16** *“Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises. Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him. Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much. Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit. My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.”*

These passages show that encouragement and comfort are **community disciplines** — shared responsibilities of believers walking in the Spirit together.

🕊 Teaching Summary & Closing Thought

When we look across these passages — a consistent picture emerges:

Encouragement and comfort are not optional extras in the Christian life; they are the heartbeat of true fellowship.

Encouragement looks like coming alongside others with truth and grace — restoring the weary **(Galatians 6:1–2)**, rejoicing and weeping together **(Romans 12:15)**, and strengthening faith through God’s Word **(Colossians 3:16)**.
Comfort, meanwhile, is the ministry of mercy and presence — sitting with those who hurt, praying for one another **(James 5:13–16)**, and reminding them of the God “who comforts us in all our affliction” **(2 Corinthians 1:3–4)**.

In all of this, we see the reflection of the Holy Spirit — our Paraklētos, the Comforter **(John 14:26)**.
When we encourage one another, we are continuing His ministry in each other’s lives.

So, encouragement isn’t simply saying, *“It’ll be okay.”*
It’s standing beside someone and saying,

*“Here’s what God has said — and He will be faithful.”* and *"I am here for you and am willing to go the distance alongside you"*

It’s truth spoken in love, and love expressed through presence.
That’s what it looks like to be a *“one another” church* — a people who remind each other that hope is never lost, because Christ Himself is with us and within us.
