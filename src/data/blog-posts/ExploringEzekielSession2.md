## What is God wanting to say to us?

At its core, studying the Bible always comes back to one simple question:
“What is God wanting to say to us?”

We’ve talked about the mechanics of Bible study—how to observe the text carefully, compare Scripture with Scripture, and pay attention to what the author is communicating.

There are also other mechanics of Scripture interpretation we have not covered, things suchas repeating phrases, or patterns and precedents, symbolism, Hebrew poetry, and even literary structures like chiastic parallels.

All of these tools remind us of something important: God is a God of order.
He speaks with purpose, and He weaves meaning into the structure and repetition of His Word.

Our study is to recognize those divine patterns so that we might truly understand what God is saying, with this in mind I want to recap what we went over in Chapter 1.

## Chapter 1 Recap

> *What was the object with the greatest impression from Chapter 1?*

- It wasn't Ezekiel and his priesthood
- It wasn't the attention to the date, although it is impressive for Ezekiel to record it for our sake.
- It wasn't the Throne of God, or the figurehead on the Throne.
- It wasn't even the wheels even though the wheels were the most prominent of the feature

> *It was what?*

- vs.1:5 *"Within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form."*
- It was the Cherubim, their description dominated Chapter 1
  - and maybe God meant it that way.  Let's review this iwith the idea of applying the principles of studying the Bible.

> *What is God trying to say to us in Chapter 1?*

### First, The Cherubim Represent All Creation

> *Key Ideas*

- Four is the number of the earth, four cardinal directions (vs.17), four corners, four winds
- Four representitives four divisions of earthly creatures God established in the Creation Week
- Four Cherubim, Four Faces, Four Wings

> *Interpretation*

- Cherubim act as a representative of all created beings, declaring that all creation exists to uphold His Glory.

> *Supporting Scripture*

- *"These rocks will cry out"*
- Revelation 5:13 - *“And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.’”*

> *Application*

- "The chief end of man, is to glorify God, and enjoy Him forever"

### Secondly, Ezekiel spent considerable time describing the elaborate wheels upon which the cherubim were carried, in synchronicity with the Lord

> *Key Ideas*

- The Spirit is in the wheels—He moves creation in perfect unity with God’s will.
- Movement is instantaneous and unhindered; no diversion, no delay.
- The wheels are “lofty and awesome,” emphasizing the majesty of divine importance, and prominence in the feature of the living beings(each having one, and the appearance of them may seem to overshadow the living beings themselves.)

> *Parallel Insight*

- Genesis 1:2 — *“The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.”*
- The same active presence energizes creation and sustains it.

> *Application*

- God’s servants move when the Spirit moves—neither ahead of Him nor apart from Him.
- Proverbs 16:9 - *"The mind of man plans his ways, but the Lord directs his steps.*

### Thirdly, with their four wings, the cherubim upheld the throne of God in all His glory

> *Key Ideas*

- God didn’t need them to hold Him up
- But He has assigned them this role, as a model for how all Creation glorify and serve God.
- In particular, Israel was created by God to glorify His name among the nations of the world

> *Principle to follow moving into Chapter 2*

- They show *reverence* for God
- They covered themselves in *humility* with two wings
- They upheld the glory of God with the other two wings (vs. 23)
- But remember also they were standing erect on their legs, *ready to serve God*

## Chapter 2 The Prophet's Call

### Scripture Reference

> **Ezekiel 2:1-5 The Prophet's Call**

> *"Then He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!” As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me. Then He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day. I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ As for them, whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them."*

> **Where did we leave Ezekiel in Chapter 1?**

- vs.28 *"I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking."*
  - Ezekiel sees the Glory of God and falls prostrate *"reverence"*

> What does God say to Ezekiel in vs. 1 of Chapter 2?

- vs.1 *"Then He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!”*
  - He addresses Ezekiel as "Son of man" serves to remind him of his humble orgins - Son of Adam *humility*

> What happens to Ezekiel in vs.2?

- vs.2 *"As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me."*
  - Ezekiel is now enabled by the Spirit *"ready to serve"*

> Let's look at another similar calling of God

- Exodus 3:1-5
  - Notice a few things, Moses first says *"I must turn aside"*
  - As he turned aside God called to him *"Do not come near here; remove your sandals, you are standing on Holy ground"*

Moses was *ready to serve*, but God required more *reverence and humility*, He was standing in the presence of the Glory of God, and he needed to acknowledge the Holiness of God.

## Ezekiel 2:1–5 — “Whether They Listen or Not”

### The Rebellious House

Before Ezekiel ever speaks a word, God prepares him for the hardest part of ministry—not the *message*, but the *people*.

> “I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me… they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.” *(Ezek. 2:3)*

Their rebellion is not ignorance—it is resistance. They have *heard* the word of the LORD before and turned away, *"their fathers"* representing the generation Moses had to deal with. This reveals one of the great theological tensions in prophetic ministry: **the prophet’s faithfulness is measured by obedience, not by results**.

Like Moses before Pharaoh, Ezekiel must confront a hardened audience. Yet where Moses protested, *“They will not listen to me” (Ex. 4:1)*, God tells Ezekiel in advance, *“They will not listen to you either.”* Still, he must speak.

In this, God reveals that faithfulness is not measured by results but by obedience. The prophet’s success is not found in how many repent, but in how obedient he delivers the message of the Living God.

### The Spectacular Call

To grasp the weight of verse 5, we must remember chapter 1—the most breathtaking call narrative in all of Scripture. Ezekiel, a priest by lineage, is caught up in a storm-wind out of the north. He sees living creatures whose movement is powered by the Spirit, wheels within wheels flashing like lightning, and above them the likeness of a throne and *“the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.” (Ezek. 1:26–28)*

He collapses in holy fear—*“I fell on my face.”* Only then does the Spirit enter him and lift him to his feet (2:2).

This is no ordinary commissioning. Isaiah saw the Lord in His temple; Moses heard Him from the burning bush; but Ezekiel beholds the mobile throne of God, the chariot of divine majesty moving even in exile. God’s glory is not confined to Jerusalem—He reigns everywhere.

Such a spectacular revelation demands an equally divine mission. The vision establishes the authority of the message before a single word is spoken: the prophet speaks from the presence of the glory he has seen.

### Verse 5 — The Key to the Call

*“As for them, whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.” (Ezek. 2:5)*

This verse crystallizes the entire book. The glory Ezekiel witnessed in chapter 1 now stands behind every word he utters. He is God’s verified representative, and his message bears divine weight whether people heed it or not.

## A Prophet Among Them

To prove that Ezekiel was truly from the LORD, God gave him near-term prophecies that unfolded within his lifetime—tangible proofs authenticating his role:

- The Siege and Fall of Jerusalem (Ezek. 4–5) — portrayed in symbolic acts, fulfilled in 586 BC.
- The Death of Pelatiah (Ezek. 11:13) — an immediate fulfillment witnessed in the vision itself.
- The Death of Ezekiel’s Wife (Ezek. 24:15-27) — announced as a sign the very day the final siege began.
- Judgments on Tyre and Egypt (Ezek. 26–32) — historically realized during Ezekiel’s ministry.

Each fulfillment echoed the divine refrain: *“Then they will know that I am the LORD.”* These near-term signs validated his authority so that Israel—and later generations—would trust his long-range prophecies of restoration, the return of God’s glory, and the coming Messianic Kingdom.

And here lies the marvel: those long-term prophecies still await complete fulfillment. More than two and a half millennia have passed, yet the vision endures. The same glory that appeared by the river Chebar will one day fill the *Millennial Temple (Ezek. 43:1-5)*, and the throne he saw will become reality when the King reigns from Jerusalem (Ezek. 37:24-28; Rev. 20:4-6).

## Interpretation Summary — Ezekiel 1–2:5

**Chapter 1 — The Vision of Glory**

1. **The Four Living Creatures Represent All Creation.**
   Each creature combines the features of different orders of life — man (intellect), lion (strength), ox (service), and eagle (swiftness). Together they symbolize the totality of God’s created order, all animated and directed by His Spirit. Creation itself exists to reflect His glory and respond in perfect obedience to His will. *(cf. Rev. 4:6–8)*
   1. **“All Creation Moves by the Spirit of the Living Beings.”**
This reveals that all created life, including angelic beings, operates under divine impulse, not independent will. The wheels, living creatures, and the throne move in one perfect unity — illustrating that **the Spirit governs all creation**.
   1. **“All Creation Upholds the Glory of God with Humility.”**
The cherubim cover themselves with their wings, acting as guardians of divine holiness. Their swift obedience and lowered posture reflect the created order’s proper position before the Creator: to exalt Him and not themselves.

**Chapter 2 — The Commission of the Prophet**

1. **Reverence or Readiness — Yes.**
   The vision in chapter 1 leaves Ezekiel prostrate before God’s glory *reverent*. In chapter 2, Ezekiel is *humbled* when God calls him *"Son of Man"* then the Spirit enters him and sets him on his feet — showing that he is now *ready for service.*

2. **The Rebellious House.**
   God identifies the people of Israel as a *“rebellious house,”* emphasizing that their condition is not ignorance but willful resistance. This rebellion is generational — *“they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day”* *(Ezek. 2:3)*.

3. **The Spectacular Call.**
   Ezekiel’s calling is unparalleled. The divine throne-chariot signifies that God’s glory is not confined to Jerusalem but is **mobile**, reigning even in exile. The same God who departed from the Temple now reveals Himself to a priest in a foreign land, declaring that His sovereignty extends over all nations. The prophet’s authority rests on what he has seen — **the enthroned glory of the LORD in motion**.

4. **Verse 5 — “A Prophet Among Them.”**

   > *“As for them, whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.”*

   The immediate events confirmed Ezekiel’s role as a true prophet so that future generations could trust his **long-term prophecies** — the restoration of Israel, the return of God’s glory to the Temple *(Ezek. 43)*, and the coming Messianic Kingdom *(Ezek. 37:24–28)*.

**Interpretive Conclusion — What God Revealed**

Through the vision and commission of Ezekiel, God declares:

- **His glory rules all creation** — nothing moves apart from His Spirit.
- **His throne is not limited by geography** — even in exile, He reigns.
- **His word stands sure** — rebellion cannot silence revelation.
- **His servants are upheld by His Spirit** — reverence prepares them; obedience sustains them.
- **His purpose unfolds through time** — near-term fulfillment verifies the word; long-term prophecy awaits its appointed hour.

## Hermeneutical Bridge — From Ezekiel to Revelation

The vision that begins Ezekiel’s ministry becomes a **template for later revelation**. Centuries later, the Apostle John, exiled on Patmos, sees the same divine realities that Ezekiel beheld by the River Chebar. Both men were isolated servants of God, both saw heaven opened, and both were commanded to write what they saw.

- In **Ezekiel 1**, the prophet beholds the *likeness of the glory of the LORD* upon a throne above the cherubim.
- In **Revelation 4–5**, John beholds *a throne set in heaven*, surrounded by living creatures who ceaselessly declare, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.”

Ezekiel was commissioned to proclaim judgment and future restoration; John was commissioned to proclaim judgment and final redemption. Both are caught up by the Spirit and shown that **God’s throne never moves in reaction to history — history moves in response to His throne.**

Thus, the bridge from Ezekiel to Revelation is **the continuity of divine glory and purpose**:

- The same Spirit that moved the wheels in Ezekiel’s vision animates the Church in Acts and inspires John’s vision on Patmos.
- The same glory that departed the Temple in Ezekiel returns in Revelation when *“the tabernacle of God is among men”* *(Rev. 21:3)*.
- The same command to speak “whether they listen or not” echoes in the Church’s call to bear witness until Christ returns.

In this way, **Ezekiel 1–2:5 forms a theological and prophetic foundation for all apocalyptic revelation** — showing that every vision of judgment, redemption, and kingdom glory flows from the same unchanging truth:

> **The Lord reigns, His glory fills creation, and His Word endures forever.**
