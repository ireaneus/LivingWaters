## Scripture Reference

**Ezekiel 2:1-5 The Prophet's Call**

> *"Then He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!” As He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me. Then He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day. I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ As for them, whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them."*

## Chapter 1 Recap

**What was the object with the greatest impression from Chapter 1?**

- It wasn't Ezekiel and his priesthood
- It wasn't the attention to the date, although it is impressive for Ezekiel to record it for our sake.
- It wasn't the Throne of God
- It wasn't even the wheels and the Holy spirit represented, here again, the wheels were the most prominent of the feature

**It was what?**

- It was the Cherubim, their description dominated Chapter 1

### First, The Cherubim Represent All Creation

**Key Ideas**

- Four is the number of the earth, four cardinal directions, four corners, four winds
- Four representitives four divisions of earthly creatures God established in the Creation Week
- Four Cherubim, Four Faces, Four Wings

**Interpretation**

- Cherubim act as a representative of all created beings, declaring that all creation exists to uphold His Glory.

**Supporting Scripture**

- *"These rocks will cry out", "Revelation 5:13 - “And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.’”*

**Application**

- *"The chief end of man, is to glorify God, and enjoy Him forever"*

### Secondly, Ezekiel spent considerable time describing the elaborate wheels upon which the cherubim were carried, in synchronicity with the Lord

**Key Ideas**

- The Spirit is in the wheels—He moves creation in perfect unity with God’s will.
- Movement is instantaneous and unhindered; no diversion, no delay.
- The wheels are “lofty and awesome,” emphasizing the majesty of divine order.

**Parallel Insight**

- Genesis 1:2 — “The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.”
- The same active presence energizes creation and sustains it.

**Application**

- God’s servants move when the Spirit moves—neither ahead of Him nor apart from Him.

### Thirdly, with their four wings, the cherubim upheld the throne of God in all His glory

**Key Ideas**

- God didn’t need them to hold Him up
- But He has assigned them this role to set the example for how all Creation should serve God
- They set the gold standard for all Creation
- Just as cherubim have been created to guard God’s glory, so should all Creation serve the same purpose
- And in particular, Israel was created by God to glorify His name among the nations of the world
- They show reverence for God
- They covered themselves in humility with two wings
- And they upheld the glory of God with the other two wings
- But remember also they were standing erect on their legs, ready to serve God

### Serving the Living God well requires a dedicated focus on upholding His glory

- We do this by following Him wholeheartedly, according to the leading of the Spirit
- Without diversions, without delay
- And when we do this, we fulfill our created purpose and we find our fulfillment in life
- Moreover, we will share in His glory as we enjoy His presence

## Chapter 2 The Prophet's Call

- The Spirit entered Ezekiel and set me on my feet.
  - Ezekiel shows readiness
- Ezekiel sees the Glory of God and falls prostrate vs. 28
- Opposite reaction is seen in Exodus 3:4-6
  - Moses approaches with sandals and standing
  - Prompts the Lord to order Moses to show greater reverence, causing Moses to hide himself

### Which should we do show readiness or Reverence? Yes

Later in Ezekiel we see that God is telling Ezekiel that these are rebellious people and they won't listen to you or to Me.
Do you see the same with Moses, Moses says I can't lead these people, they won't listen to me...

The contrast here is that Moses was a little to ready to serve and Ezekiel was just entering the Priesthood and now being a prophet.
But in both cases God said, I will give you the power to serve Me.
Moses with a staff, and Ezekiel with the Spirit.

Son of Man - Son of Adam (dirt) Humble

- We must combine humility with a self-sacrificial willingness to stand with God regardless of what may come

**Are you like Moses, ready to serve but without an appreciation for the power of God to make your service useful?**

**Or are you like Ezekiel? So enraptured by the presence of God that you’ve overlooked the reason He revealed Himself to you in the first place?**

### The Spirit of God entered Ezekiel which resulted in Ezekiel standing on his feet

- During the Old Testament dispensation, the Spirit of God worked differently among God’s people
- The Spirit didn’t permanently indwell a saint as He does today
- Instead, the Spirit would come upon a person temporarily to empower them to serve God in a certain way
- **2 Peter 1:20-21** - *"But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."*

- He lay prostrate because of the awesome glory of God
- But now he stands ready to serve this awesome God by means of the Spirit of God
- 4 years of the exile of 70 years, still holding to their own ways - rebellious heart
  - 1st time Israel is back in captivity since Eygpt.
- Stubborn and Obstinate
  - Stubborn hard face, honor, face, east, humiliation - relate to Pride - East is direction of Sin, rebellion 'qasheh panim'
  - Obstinate - "Who is stronger?"

**vs 5**

- Key verse - you speak whether they listen or not. (sets up the rest of the book)
  - Other reasons, to demonstrate there is a Prophet among them.

### Prophesy not for the Exiles but spectacular

- near term prophecies come to pass authenticating the long term
- I want you to do it anyways - going in no results, you may not see the results, but through the seeds planted.
- God always has a bigger purpose in your service, He is constantly using your service to accomplish eternal outcomes.
- So operate in that faith now, and see what He can accomplish

## We must come to God in revernce and ready to serve Him
