## Worship Part 1 - Who are the True Worshippers?

*(pause, look at the congregation)*  

Why do churches fill with people week after week?  

Why do we come together in *a building*, at *a certain* time?  

- For some, church may feel like a social event — a place to see friends.  
- For others, maybe it’s the music, the singing, or the preaching that draws them.  
- Some come because it’s a family tradition, something they’ve always done.  
- Others feel it’s just what good people are supposed to do on Sunday.  

*(slight pause, slower tone)*  

But if we peel back all those reasons — good or bad, deep or shallow — we’re left with the real question:  

**Why are we here, doing what we’ve always done?**  

*(lean in, voice firm)*  

The question every believer should be asking is this:  
*“What am I supposed to be doing between now and eternity?”*  

We know we’re called to the Great Commission…  
But week after week, so many of us shuffle into a building, almost by habit.  
We sing some songs.  
We listen to someone preach.  
And then we go home.  

*(pause, voice rising)*  

But, I believe that the Westminster Shorter Catechism Question 1 answers life’s deepest question: **“Why am I here?”**

> **Q. 1. What is the chief end of man?**  
> **A. Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.**

The Bible echoes this:

> *“Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God.”*  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:31 (NASB2020)**  

> *“For from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.”*  
> — **Romans 11:36 (NASB2020)**  

> *“The people whom I formed for Myself will declare My praise.”*  
> — **Isaiah 43:21 (NASB2020)**  

> *“In Your presence is fullness of joy; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever.”*  
> — **Psalm 16:11 (NASB2020)**  

*(stronger)* If something as ordinary as eating or drinking is to be done for His glory… how much more the gathering of His people in worship!  

*(lean forward, passionate)*  

## True Biblical Worship Revealed - Spirit and Truth

> *But a time is coming, and even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.*  
> — **John 4:23-24 (NASB2020)**  

This is what God is looking for in our worship of Him.  We must worship Him in Spirit and Truth

In **Revelation 4**, we are given a glimpse of heaven — of the throne room of God — where the saints and the angels fall down and cry out:  

> *“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.”*  
> — **Revelation 4:8 (NASB2020)**  

And notice — the angels sing this **day and night, without ceasing**.  

Then the twenty-four elders — representing the whole church, the redeemed of all ages — respond continually in worship:  

> *“Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory, honor, and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.”*  
> — **Revelation 4:11 (NASB2020)**  

So, if you truly believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever, then biblical worship is not just what you *ought* to be doing — it is what you should *long* to be doing.  

The question we need to ask is: *What is Biblical Worship?*  

*(pause, then directly to the heart)*  

So let me put it plainly:  
If the reason we gather is to worship God…  
And as Pastor Jack would say, *“If you want to go on with God”*…  
And if you truly desire to glorify Him…  
Then you must ask yourself today:  

**“Is what I am doing true biblical worship — and is it pleasing to God?”**

## The New Explained What the Old Contained

Before we can answer *how* to worship, we first need to know *how to read our Bibles*.  

The Bible is one story. The Old Testament gives us patterns, pictures, and shadows, while the New Testament reveals their meaning and fulfillment in Christ.  

This is a basic principle of interpretation:  

> *“The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed.”*  
> *“The Old is the New contained; the New is the Old explained.”*  

That means we cannot understand the New Testament fully without the Old, and we cannot understand the Old without the New. The two belong together, speaking with one voice and pointing us to Christ.  

Paul himself shows us this in **1 Corinthians 10**, where he takes the physical events of Israel’s history and explains their spiritual significance for the church:  

> *“For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and they all passed through the sea; and they all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and they all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.”*  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:1–4 (NASB2020)**  

> *“Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they indeed craved them.”*  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:6 (NASB2020)**  

> *“Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.”*  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:11 (NASB2020)**  

Paul is saying that the Old Testament events were not just history — they were examples, written for us. They are physical realities that teach spiritual truths, all pointing us to Christ.

## What does True Biblical Worship not look like?

We've just seen what **True Biblical Worship looks like in glory**, but do we also have examples of worship that is *not* true — so that we don’t fall into the same trap of offering “strange fire” to the Lord?  

The Old Testament gives us a sobering warning about the danger of worshiping on our own terms:  

> *Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on the fire and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them. And fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. Then Moses said to Aaron, “It is what the Lord spoke, saying, ‘By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honored.’ ” So Aaron, therefore, kept silent.*  
> — **Leviticus 10:1–3 (NASB2020)**  

Do you see it? The problem wasn’t that Nadab and Abihu failed to worship — it was that they tried to worship in their own way, not in God’s way. God had commanded how He was to be approached, and they thought they could improve it, alter it, or innovate. The result was judgment.  

And Paul warns the Corinthian church with the same principle:  

> *Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For the one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not properly recognize the body. For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep.*  
> — **1 Corinthians 11:27–30 (NASB2020)**  

Did you hear that? *“Many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep.”* This is the "Lord's Supper" — one of the ordinances of the church. We recognize this, don’t we? The two ordinances we hold are **The Lord’s Supper (Communion)** and **Baptism**. Both are central to a typical worship service.  

So if God’s judgment falls on how we approach the table — and that is just one part of a worship service — what can we conclude about the seriousness of how we approach worship as a whole?  

And it doesn’t stop there. The book of Acts shows us another example of false worship:  

> *But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, and kept back some of the proceeds for himself, with his wife’s full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles’ feet. But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the proceeds of the land? ... You have not lied to men, but to God.” And as he heard these words, Ananias collapsed and died… Now great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard about these things.*  
> — **Acts 5:1–5, 11 (NASB2020)**  

Their offering looked like worship on the outside, but in truth it was deceitful, hypocritical, and self-serving. And again, God’s judgment was immediate.

## Who Can Offer Up True Biblical Worship?

If God is this holy, then who can come before Him? Who can offer worship that is acceptable in His sight?  

In the Old Testament, not everyone could approach God. God set apart the tribe of **Levi** for service (Numbers 3:12), but only **Aaron and his sons** were chosen to serve as priests (Exodus 28:1). And from Aaron’s sons, one man served as High Priest, entering the Holy of Holies once a year (Leviticus 16).  

But before any priest could minister, he had to be **consecrated**. And God gave seven steps — a complete consecration — to prepare the priests for service.  

---

## The Seven Steps of Priestly Consecration (Old Testament Pattern)

Before any priest could serve in the Tabernacle, he had to be consecrated. God commanded Moses to follow seven steps to set apart Aaron and his sons for service. These steps are recorded primarily in Exodus 29 and Leviticus 8.

1. **Washed with Water**  
   > *“Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.”*  
   — **Exodus 29:4; cf. Leviticus 8:6**

2. **Clothed in Priestly Garments**  
   > *“Then you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the tunic and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod and the breastpiece, and wrap him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod… You shall clothe Aaron’s sons with tunics; and you shall wrap sashes around them…”*  
   — **Exodus 29:5, 8–9; cf. Leviticus 8:7–9, 13**

3. **Anointed with Oil**  
   > *“Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head, and anoint him.”*  
   — **Exodus 29:7; cf. Leviticus 8:10–12**

4. **Sin Offering (Bull)**  
   > *“You shall slaughter the bull before the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting.”*  
   — **Exodus 29:10–11; cf. Leviticus 8:14–17**

5. **Burnt Offering (Ram)**  
   > *“You shall slaughter the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle it around on the altar.”*  
   — **Exodus 29:15–18; cf. Leviticus 8:18–21**

6. **Ram of Ordination — Blood on Ear, Hand, Foot**  
   > *“Then you shall slaughter the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the lobes of his sons’ right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet.”*  
   — **Exodus 29:19–21; cf. Leviticus 8:22–30**

7. **Seven Days of Consecration**  
   > *“…you shall ordain them through seven days. Every day you shall offer the bull as a sin offering for atonement…”*  
   — **Exodus 29:35–37; cf. Leviticus 8:33–36**

## The Seven Steps of Consecration Fulfilled in Christ (New Testament)

The Old Testament priests were consecrated in seven steps before serving in God’s presence. In the New Testament, each of these finds its fulfillment in Christ’s finished work for His saints. At new birth, the believer is fully consecrated — not by our works, but by Christ on our behalf.

1. **Washed with Water**  
   > *“Jesus answered him, ‘If I do not wash you, you have no place with Me… The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, otherwise he is completely clean; and you are clean.’”*  
   — **John 13:8, 10 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“…so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word…”*  
   — **Ephesians 5:26 (NASB2020)**  

---

2. **Clothed in Priestly Garments**  
   > *“For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”*  
   — **Galatians 3:27 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“…they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”*  
   — **Revelation 7:14 (NASB2020)**  

---

3. **Anointed with Oil**  
   > *“…you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is a first installment of our inheritance…”*  
   — **Ephesians 1:13–14 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.”*  
   — **1 John 2:20 (NASB2020)**  

---

4. **Sin Offering (Bull)**  
   > *“…in Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our wrongdoings, according to the riches of His grace.”*  
   — **Ephesians 1:7 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”*  
   — **2 Corinthians 5:21 (NASB2020)**  

---

5. **Burnt Offering (Ram)**  
   > *“…Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.”*  
   — **Ephesians 5:2 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.”*  
   — **Hebrews 10:10 (NASB2020)**  

---

6. **Ram of Ordination — Ear, Hand, Foot**  
   > *“Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.”*  
   — **Romans 12:1 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves.”*  
   — **James 1:22 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.”*  
   — **Ephesians 2:10 (NASB2020)**  

---

7. **Seven Days of Consecration**  
   > *“For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.”*  
   — **Hebrews 10:14 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, … to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice.”*  
   — **Romans 12:1 (NASB2020)**  

   > *“Through Him then let’s continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips praising His name.”*  
   — **Hebrews 13:15 (NASB2020)**

## Who Are the True Worshippers? (Closing Emphasis)

The priests of the Old Testament had to walk through **seven steps** before they were fully consecrated to serve the Lord. Seven in Scripture is the number of **completion, fullness, and perfection**. When they had completed all seven steps, they were **completely set apart** for God’s service.  

In the same way, the New Testament believer is **fully consecrated at new birth** — not by our works, but by Christ who has perfectly fulfilled every step of consecration on our behalf.  

- Washed by His Word and Spirit.  
- Clothed in His righteousness.  
- Anointed by the Holy Spirit.  
- Justified by His blood.  
- Offered up wholly as His.  
- Consecrated in ear, hand, and foot.  
- Made complete forever by His one sacrifice.  

📌 This means when we gather, we don’t come as casual attenders — we come as a **holy priesthood**, already consecrated in Christ, offering spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God (1 Peter 2:5).  

---

### Examine Yourselves, Confess, Rid Distractions, and Prayer  

So what about Paul’s warnings to “examine yourselves” (1 Corinthians 11:28)? What about confession, prayer, and setting aside distractions?  

These are not **requirements to make ourselves worthy** — Christ has already consecrated us fully. Instead, they are **acts of preparation** that flow out of what Christ has done:  

- **Examine yourselves** → not to see if we can earn our way in, but to remember: *Am I walking in Christ’s cleansing, His Spirit, His righteousness?* (2 Corinthians 13:5).  
- **Confess your sins** → the priest confessed over the bull; we confess ours knowing He is faithful to forgive (1 John 1:9).  
- **Rid distractions** → set aside weights that entangle so we can focus wholly on Christ (Hebrews 12:1–2).  
- **Prayer** → consecrates our minds and hearts as we prepare to enter worship (Philippians 4:6–7).  

📌 These are the practical expressions of a heart that knows it has already been consecrated in Christ.

### What is Corporate Worship?  

Corporate worship is simply **God’s people gathered together to glorify Him through Christ**.  

- **Hebrews 10:24–25**  
  > *“…let’s consider how to encourage one another in love and good deeds, not abandoning our own meeting together, as is the habit of some people, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.”*  

- **1 Corinthians 14:26**  
  > *“What is the outcome then, brothers and sisters? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things are to be done for edification.”*  

- **Acts 2:42**  
  > *“They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.”*  

Corporate worship is not about preference, performance, or tradition. It is the church — God’s consecrated people — coming together in Christ to glorify Him and to build one another up.  

---

### Final Exhortation  

So who are the true worshippers?  

They are the ones who have been consecrated completely in Christ.  
They are the ones who worship the Father in spirit and truth.  
They are the ones who gather not casually, but consecrated.  

**God has made His people holy — completely, perfectly, wholly consecrated in Christ.**  

So let us not come lightly, but let us come joyfully, offering to Him the worship He is worthy of — now and forever.
