## Worship Part 1 - Introduction

## Sermon Introduction (Spoken Transcript)

*(pause, look at the congregation)*  

Why do churches across America fill with people week after week?  

Why do we come together in *a building*, at *a certain* time?  

For some, church may feel like a social event — a place to see friends.  
For others, maybe it’s the music, the singing, or the preaching that draws them.  
Some come because it’s a family tradition, something they’ve always done.  
Others feel it’s just what good people are supposed to do on Sunday.  

*(slight pause, slower tone)*  

But if we peel back all those reasons — good or bad, deep or shallow — we’re left with the real question:  

**Why are we here, doing what we’ve always done?**  

*(lean in, voice firm)*  

The question every believer should be asking is this:  
*“What am I supposed to be doing between now and eternity?”*  

We know we’re called to the Great Commission…  
But week after week, so many of us shuffle into a building, almost by habit.  
We sing some songs.  
We listen to someone preach.  
And then we go home.  

*(pause, voice rising)*  

But, I believe that the Westminster Shorter Catechism Question 1 answers life’s deepest question: **“Why am I here?”**  

> *Q. 1. What is the chief end of man?*  
> *A. Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.*

That is why you exist.  
That is why I exist.  
That is the very purpose for which we breathe.  

*(pause, then read with weight)*  

And Paul drives it home in **1 Corinthians 10:31**:  
*“Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God.”*  

*(stronger)* If something as ordinary as eating or drinking is to be done for His glory… how much more the gathering of His people in worship!  

*(lean forward, passionate)*  

And don’t miss this: worship is not optional, and it’s not temporary.  
In **Revelation 4**, we are given a glimpse of heaven — of the throne room of God — where the saints and the angels fall down and cry out:  

*“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.”*  

That is your eternal destiny.  
That is your forever song.  
If you belong to Christ, you will be worshiping for all eternity.  

So why would we not want to begin living that reality now?  

*(firm, slower)*  

Hear me clearly: Sunday worship is not a ritual.  
It’s not just tradition.  
It is heaven’s rehearsal here on earth.  

And if you truly believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever, then biblical worship is not just what you *ought* to be doing — it is what you should *long* to be doing.  

So the question we need to ask is: *What is Biblical Worship?*  

*(pause, then directly to the heart)*  

So let me put it plainly:  
If the reason we gather is to worship God…  
And as Pastor Jack would say, *“If you want to go on with God”*…  
And if you truly desire to glorify Him…  
Then you must ask yourself today:  

**“Is what I am doing true biblical worship — and is it pleasing to God?”**

---

## Transition from Introduction

So how do we know what true Biblical Worship looks like?  

The answer is this:  

> *“The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed.”*  
> *“The Old is the New contained; the New is the Old explained.”*  

The Bible is **one story** — and what was concealed in the Old is revealed in the New. The Old Testament gives us patterns and pictures, and the New Testament unveils their meaning, all pointing to Christ.  

Paul shows us this in **1 Corinthians 10**.  

---

## The New Explained What the Old Contained

> *For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and they all passed through the sea; and they all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and they all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ. Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased; for their dead bodies were spread out in the wilderness. **Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they indeed craved them… Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.***  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:1-11 (NASB2020)**  

Paul says these things were written as examples for us — yes. But more importantly, notice how every example points us to Christ.  

- They ate manna in the wilderness and drank from the rock, but Paul tells us the true meaning:  
  > *“…and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.”*  
  — **1 Corinthians 10:3–4 (NASB2020)**  

  Jesus Himself declared:  
  > *“I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.”*  
  — **John 6:48–51 (NASB2020)**  

  The manna and the rock were not just wilderness provisions — they were **pictures of Christ Himself**: the Bread of Life who satisfies forever, and the Rock from whom living water flows.  

The Old Testament gives us the shadows, and Christ is the substance. So as we look to all of Scripture, both New and Old, we will see what true biblical worship is. Jesus makes it plain in **John 4:23–24**:  

> *But a time is coming, and even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.*  
> — **John 4:23-24 (NASB2020)**  

True worship has always been about Christ. The Tabernacle, the sacrifices, the ordinances — all of them pointed forward to Him.

### How do we Worship?

The Old and New Testaments give us a warning about how we are to worship, if do it wrong we are at risk of some serious consequences.

The Old Testament shows us the danger of worshiping on our own terms:  

> *Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on the fire and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them. And fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. Then Moses said to Aaron, “It is what the Lord spoke, saying, ‘By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honored.’ ” So Aaron, therefore, kept silent.*  
> — **Leviticus 10:1–3 (NASB2020)**  

Their worship was not according to God’s command, and it cost them their lives.  

And Paul warns the Corinthian church with the same principle:  

> *Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For the one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not properly recognize the body. For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep.*  
> — **1 Corinthians 11:27–30 (NASB2020)**  

Did you hear that? *“Many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep.”* This is the "Lord's Supper" it is one of the Ordinances of the Church.  We recognize this right?  The 2 ordinances we hold are The Lord's Supper (Communion) and the other is Baptism. This is a part of a typical "Worship" service. So if God's judgment is on how we approach the table, and that is just a part of a "Worship" service. So what can we conclude?

**God is holy. Worship is not casual. And Christ is our only object of true worship.**  

---

## How do we examine ourselves?

This brings us to the question: *If worship is not casual, how then do we prepare ourselves to come before the Lord?*  

In the Old Testament, the priests could not perform the daily rituals within God's tabernacle without consecration:

## The Priests’ Consecration (Order and Actions)

### 1. **Washed with Water**

- **Action**: Aaron and his sons were brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting and washed with water.
- **Purpose**: This outward washing symbolized cleansing and readiness to enter God’s service.
- **Scripture**:

  > *“Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:4; cf. Exodus 40:12**

---

### 2. **Clothed in Priestly Garments**

- **Action**: The High Priest was dressed in the holy garments: tunic, robe, ephod, breastpiece, sash, turban, and crown. The sons of Aaron were clothed in tunics, sashes, and caps.
- **Purpose**: To set them apart visibly as holy servants of God.
- **Scripture**:

  > *“Then you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the tunic and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod and the breastpiece, and wrap him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:5**
  > *“You shall clothe Aaron’s sons with tunics; and you shall wrap sashes around them… so that they may have the priesthood by a permanent statute.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:8–9**

---

### 3. **Anointed with Oil**

- **Action**: Moses poured anointing oil on Aaron’s head; the tabernacle and all its furniture were also anointed.
- **Purpose**: This symbolized the consecration of the priest and the Spirit’s empowerment for service.
- **Scripture**:

  > *“Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head, and anoint him.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:7**
  > *“Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything that was in it… He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.”*
  > — **Leviticus 8:10–12**

---

### 4. **Sin Offering**

- **Action**: A bull was sacrificed as a sin offering for Aaron and his sons. Its blood was applied to the altar, and the rest of the animal burned outside the camp.
- **Purpose**: To atone for their sins before they could serve.
- **Scripture**:

  > *“Then you shall take the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull. And you shall slaughter the bull before the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:10–11**

---

### 5. **Burnt Offering**

- **Action**: A ram was sacrificed as a burnt offering.
- **Purpose**: Signifying total dedication and consecration to the Lord.
- **Scripture**:

  > *“You shall also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram; and you shall slaughter the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle it around on the altar.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:15–16**

---

### 6. **Ordination (Ram of Consecration)**

- **Action**: A second ram (the ram of ordination) was sacrificed. Blood was applied to Aaron and his sons — to the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot. Portions of the ram and unleavened bread were waved before the Lord and then eaten by the priests.
- **Purpose**: To symbolize consecration of their whole person — hearing (ear), serving (hand), and walking (foot).
- **Scripture**:

  > *“Then you shall slaughter the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the lobes of his sons’ right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet; and sprinkle the rest of the blood around on the altar.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:20; cf. Leviticus 8:22–24**

---

### 7. **Continual Burnt Offering and Seven Days of Consecration**

- **Action**: The process was repeated for seven days, with daily offerings.
- **Purpose**: To fully consecrate them for priestly service.
- **Scripture**:

  > *“You shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh… Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket… Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, in accordance with everything that I have commanded you; you shall ordain them through seven days.”*
  > — **Exodus 29:31–35**

---

## 1. *“Examine yourselves”* — What does that mean?

Paul uses the phrase in **1 Corinthians 11:28**:  

> *“But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.”* — **NASB2020**  

And again in **2 Corinthians 13:5**:  

> *“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you—unless indeed you fail the test?”* — **NASB2020**  

---

## 2. How the First Four Steps of Consecration Parallel Our Justification

The priests in the Old Testament could not minister until they were consecrated by washing, clothing, anointing, and blood. These were shadows of the reality fulfilled in Christ for every believer.  

1. **Washing with Water**  
   - **OT Priests**: Aaron and his sons were washed with water before service (Exodus 29:4).  
   - **NT Saints**: Jesus washed His disciples’ feet, saying,  
     > *“Then He poured water into the basin, and began washing the disciples’ feet and wiping them with the towel which He had tied around Himself. 6So He came to Simon Peter. He said to Him, “Lord, You are washing my feet?” 7Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing, you do not realize right now, but you will understand later.” 8Peter said to Him, “Never shall You wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no place with Me.” 9Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!” 10Jesus said to him, “He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet; otherwise he is completely clean. And you are clean—but not all of you.” 11For He knew the one who was betraying Him; it was for this reason that He said, “Not all of you are clean.” 12Then, when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, “Do you know what I have done for you? 13You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’; and you are correct, for so I am. 14So if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. 15For I gave you an example, so that you also would do just as I did for you.”* — **John 13:6-15 (NASB2020)**  

2. **Clothed in Garments**  
   - **OT Priests**: Aaron was clothed in holy garments to minister (Exodus 29:5–9).  
   - **NT Saints**: We are clothed in Christ Himself:  
     > *“For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”* — **Galatians 3:27 (NASB2020)**  
     > *“…they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”* — **Revelation 7:14 (NASB2020)**  

3. **Anointed with Oil**  
   - **OT Priests**: Oil was poured on Aaron’s head as a sign of consecration (Exodus 29:7).  
   - **NT Saints**: We are sealed with the Holy Spirit:  
     > *“…you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is a first installment of our inheritance…”* — **Ephesians 1:13–14 (NASB2020)**  

4. **Blood of the Sacrifice**  
   - **OT Priests**: Blood was shed on behalf of the priests and placed on altar, ear, hand, and foot (Exodus 29:10–14, 20–21).  
   - **NT Saints**: We are justified by the blood of Christ:  
     > *“…in Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our wrongdoings, according to the riches of His grace.”* — **Ephesians 1:7 (NASB2020)**  
     > *“…having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.”* — **Romans 5:9 (NASB2020)**  

---

## 3. Confessing Our Sins — Part of Consecration

- **OT Priests**: The priest laid his hands on the sin offering, confessing sins and symbolically transferring guilt to the sacrifice (Leviticus 4:4).  
- **NT Saints**: We confess directly to Christ, the true sacrifice:  
  > *“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous, so that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”* — **1 John 1:9 (NASB2020)**  

---

## 4. Setting Aside Distractions — Part of Consecration

Yes — distractions flow from the flesh, and they hinder true worship.  

Paul exhorts:  
> *“…let’s rid ourselves of every obstacle and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let’s run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking only at Jesus, the originator and perfecter of the faith.”* — **Hebrews 12:1–2 (NASB2020)**  

---

## 5. Fulfillment in Christ  

The priests’ consecration was only a shadow. Our consecration is fulfilled in Christ:  

- Washed by His Word and Spirit.  
- Clothed in His righteousness.  
- Anointed and sealed with His Spirit.  
- Justified by His blood.  

So when Paul says *“Examine yourselves”*, he is not calling us to self-reliance, but to see if we are truly in Christ — resting in what He has already done.  

> *“…you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.”* — **1 Peter 2:5 (NASB2020)**  

📌 True consecration for worship is not found in ourselves — it is found in Christ alone.
