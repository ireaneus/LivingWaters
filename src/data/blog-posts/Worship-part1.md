## Worship Part 1 - Introduction

## Sermon Introduction (Spoken Transcript)

*(pause, look at the congregation)*  

Why do churches across America fill with people week after week?  

Why do we come together in *a building*, at *a certain* time?  

For some, church may feel like a social event — a place to see friends.  
For others, maybe it’s the music, the singing, or the preaching that draws them.  
Some come because it’s a family tradition, something they’ve always done.  
Others feel it’s just what good people are supposed to do on Sunday.  

*(slight pause, slower tone)*  

But if we peel back all those reasons — good or bad, deep or shallow — we’re left with the real question:  

**Why are we here, doing what we’ve always done?**  

*(lean in, voice firm)*  

The question every believer should be asking is this:  
*“What am I supposed to be doing between now and eternity?”*  

We know we’re called to the Great Commission…  
But week after week, so many of us shuffle into a building, almost by habit.  
We sing some songs.  
We listen to someone preach.  
And then we go home.  

*(pause, voice rising)*  

But, I believe that the Westminster Shorter Catechism Question 1 answers life’s deepest question: **“Why am I here?”**  

> *Q. 1. What is the chief end of man?*  
> *A. Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.*

That is why you exist.  
That is why I exist.  
That is the very purpose for which we breathe.  

*(pause, then read with weight)*  

And Paul drives it home in **1 Corinthians 10:31**:  
*“Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God.”*  

*(stronger)* If something as ordinary as eating or drinking is to be done for His glory… how much more the gathering of His people in worship!  

*(lean forward, passionate)*  

And don’t miss this: worship is not optional, and it’s not temporary.  
In **Revelation 4**, we are given a glimpse of heaven — of the throne room of God — where the saints and the angels fall down and cry out:  

*“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.”*  

That is your eternal destiny.  
That is your forever song.  
If you belong to Christ, you will be worshiping for all eternity.  

So why would we not want to begin living that reality now?  

*(firm, slower)*  

Hear me clearly: Sunday worship is not a ritual.  
It’s not just tradition.  
It is heaven’s rehearsal here on earth.  

And if you truly believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever, then biblical worship is not just what you *ought* to be doing — it is what you should *long* to be doing.  

So the question we need to ask is: *What is Biblical Worship?*  

*(pause, then directly to the heart)*  

So let me put it plainly:  
If the reason we gather is to worship God…  
And as Pastor Jack would say, *“If you want to go on with God”*…  
And if you truly desire to glorify Him…  
Then you must ask yourself today:  

**“Is what I am doing true biblical worship — and is it pleasing to God?”**

## Transition from Introduction

So how do we know what true Biblical Worship looks like?  

The answer is this:  

> *“The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed.”*  
> *“The Old is the New contained; the New is the Old explained.”*  

The Bible is **one story** — and what was concealed in the Old is revealed in the New. The Old Testament gives us patterns and pictures, and the New Testament unveils their meaning, all pointing to Christ.  

Paul shows us this in **1 Corinthians 10**.  

---

## The New Explained What the Old Contained

> *For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and they all passed through the sea; and they all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and they all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ. Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased; for their dead bodies were spread out in the wilderness. **Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they indeed craved them… Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.***  
> — **1 Corinthians 10:1-11 (NASB2020)**  

Paul says these things were written as examples for us — yes. But more importantly, notice how every example points us to Christ.  

- They ate manna in the wilderness and drank from the rock, but Paul tells us the true meaning:  
  > *“…and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.”*  
  — **1 Corinthians 10:3–4 (NASB2020)**  

  Jesus Himself declared:  
  > *“I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.”*  
  — **John 6:48–51 (NASB2020)**  

  The manna and the rock were not just wilderness provisions — they were **pictures of Christ Himself**: the Bread of Life who satisfies forever, and the Rock from whom living water flows.  

The Old Testament gives us the shadows, and Christ is the substance. So as we look to all of Scripture, both New and Old, we will see what true biblical worship is. Jesus makes it plain in **John 4:23–24**:  

> *But a time is coming, and even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.*  
> — **John 4:23-24 (NASB2020)**  

True worship has always been about Christ. The Tabernacle, the sacrifices, the ordinances — all of them pointed forward to Him.  

### Do you see the severity of His warning?

The Old Testament reminds us what happens when people try to worship on their own terms, apart from God’s command:

> *Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on the fire and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them. And fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. Then Moses said to Aaron, “It is what the Lord spoke, saying, ‘By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honored.’ ” So Aaron, therefore, kept silent.*
> — **Leviticus 10:1–3 (NASB2020)**

> *And to Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the Lord. Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel.*
> — **Numbers 26:60–62 (NASB2020)**

Their worship was not according to God’s command, and it cost them their lives. Not only Nadab and Abihu perished, but twenty-three thousand males from a month old and upward were cut off, and they were not numbered among the sons of Israel.

And Paul carries this same warning into the New Testament. Just as the priests had to consecrate themselves before entering the Holy Place, we too must examine ourselves before coming into the Lord’s presence:

> *Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For the one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not properly recognize the body. For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep.*
> — **1 Corinthians 11:27–30 (NASB2020)**

Did you get that? *"Many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep"*

Do you see the continuity? From Israel in the wilderness, to the priests in the Tabernacle, to the church at Corinth — the message is the same:

**God is holy. Worship is not casual. And Christ is our only object of true worship. He is to be the reason we rise in the morning, and He is to be worshiped daily — and all the more when we gather together as His people.**

The writer of Hebrews reminds us:

> *“…and let’s consider how to encourage one another in love and good deeds, not abandoning our own meeting together, as is the habit of some people, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.”*
> — **Hebrews 10:24–25 (NASB2020)**

So we dare not treat our “gathering together” lightly.

**Application:**
When we come before the Lord in worship, we must come with consecrated hearts. Before we sing a note, before we pray a prayer, before we hear the Word preached, before we take the bread and the cup — we must prepare ourselves.

- We examine our hearts.
- We confess our sins.
- We set aside our distractions.
- We remember who it is we are coming before: the Holy One, before whom the angels cover their faces.

`[We will need to ask the question "how" and answer these later]`

This is not casual. This is not tradition. This is worship — the eternal calling of the redeemed.

So the question remains: **When you gather with God’s people, are you coming with a heart consecrated to worship Him? Or are you just going through the motions?**

🔥 This would be a perfect spot to pause — let it hang, maybe even bow in prayer — before moving into the **Old Testament Example** section.

## Old Testament Example of Biblical Worship

- Israel’s High Priest entered the Holy of Holies into the Presence of God.  
- The Tabernacle illustration:  
  - Gate → Altar → 2nd Curtain → Holy Place.  
  - Outer Court → Holy Place → Holy of Holies.  
  - Ark of the Covenant: manna, rod that budded, tablets.  
  - Lampstand, showbread, altar of incense.  
- Only one gate into the outer court.  
- John 14:6 *"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me."*  
- The curtain veil torn (Matthew 27:50-51) — showing Jesus is our High Priest.  
- Resurrection as firstfruits.  
- We don’t move until God says to move.

### Redeem Two Peoples (Stars and Sand)

**Genesis 15:9-20**  
> *So He said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds... On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.”*  

- Heifer = sin offering.  
- Female goat = sins imputed (Leviticus 16).  
- Ram = substitution.  
- Turtledove = peace.  
- Pigeon = singleness of purpose.  
- God made covenant with Himself on Abram’s behalf.  
- Promise of the land.  
- The Tabernacle pictures Christ (John 1:14).  
  - *“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt (tabernacled) among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.”*
