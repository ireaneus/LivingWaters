### Scripture Reference

> *For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and they all passed through the sea; 2and they all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 3and they all ate the same spiritual food, 4and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ. 5Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased; for their dead bodies were spread out in the wilderness. **6Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they indeed craved them. 11Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come***
> —**1 Corinthians 10:1-11**

> *But a time is coming, and even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. 24God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth*
> —**John 4:23-24**

> *Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on the fire and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them.*
> —**Leviticus 10:1**

> *But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the Lord. 62Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel.*
> —**Numbers 26:1**

> *But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 29For the one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not properly recognize the body. 30For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep. 31But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged. 32But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.*
> —**1 Corinthians 11:28-30**
