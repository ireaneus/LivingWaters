description: This Bible study guide combines the insights of Fruchtenbaum's hermeneutics, inductive Bible study methods from Verse by Verse Ministry, and my personal theological convictions. It is structured to train disciples to **observe**, **interpret**, **evaluate**, and **apply** Scripture — not as a manual for moral rules, but as the grand **revelation of Jesus Christ**.

## Why Study the Bible

> **Psalm 119:18 (NASB1995)**  
> *Open my eyes, that I may behold wonderful things from Your Law.*

The first question isn’t *how*, but *why* we want to study the Bible.

- Is it to grow in love and knowledge of Christ?
- Is it to be transformed by the renewing of our mind?
- Is it to equip ourselves to serve and witness?

## The Christocentric Nature of Scripture

The Bible is **Christcentric - John 5:39** - *You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me.*  

> **Luke 24:27 (NASB1995)**  
> *Then beginning with Moses and with all the Prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.*[^4]

> **Revelation 1:1**
> *"The Revelation of Jesus Christ,"* (NASB1995)

From Genesis to Revelation, **all of Scripture speaks exclusively and supremely of Jesus Christ**. He is not merely a theme among others; He is the **substance**, the **subject**, and the **fulfillment** of every divine word. The Bible does not offer moral guidance detached from Christ — it is the unfolding drama of redemption with **Jesus as its Author, Center, and Goal**.

## The New is in the Old

> The NEW is in the OLD contained - the OLD is in the NEW explained  
> The NEW is in the OLD concealed - the OLD is in the NEW revealed [^3]

| Phrase | Meaning |
| :------: | :-----: |
| **The New is in the Old concealed** | Christ and the gospel are present in types, shadows, and promises |
| **The Old is in the New revealed** | The New Testament unveils the full meaning of the Old |
| **The Old is the New contained** | The Old Testament holds the foundation of New Testament truths |
| **The New is the Old explained** | The New interprets, fulfills, and clarifies the Old |

> **Colossians 2:17**  
> "Things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ." (NASB1995)

> **Hebrews 10:1**  
> "For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things..." (NASB1995)

## Four basic elements of Interpretation

[^2]

### 1. Observation – *What does the text say?*

- Pay attention to key words, grammar, structure, and genre.
- Ask: Who? What? When? Where? Why?

> **Hebrews 5:11–14**  
> "...solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil." *(NASB1995)*

---

### 2. Interpretation – *What did the author mean?*

- Context is king: historical, grammatical, cultural.
- There is **one intended meaning**, not many.
- Let **Scripture interpret Scripture**.

> **2 Peter 1:19–21**  
> "So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the  day dawns and the morning star arises  in your hearts. But know this first of all, that  no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." *(NASB1995)*

---

### 3. Evaluation & Application – *What truths are timeless?*

- Identify what applies to all believers and what was covenant-specific.
- Application flows from sound interpretation — not emotion or tradition.

> **James 1:22**  
> "But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves." *(NASB1995)*

---

### 4. Correlation – *How does it fit the rest of Scripture?*

- Cross-reference and harmonize doctrines.
- Consider dispensational distinctions, covenants, and biblical theology.

> **2 Timothy 3:16–17**  
> "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness..." *(NASB1995)*

## FOUR RULES OF HERMENEUTICS

[^1]

### 1. Golden Rule of Interpretation

> "When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense."

Take words in their **ordinary, literal meaning** unless context dictates otherwise.

---

### 2. Law of Double Reference  

A single passage may refer to **two events or persons** separated by time.

> **Isaiah 61:1–2** → Partial fulfillment in **Luke 4:18–19**

---

### 3. Law of Recurrence  

Scripture may revisit the same event with more details.

> **Genesis 1:26–27** — Creation summary  
> **Genesis 2:7–25** — Detailed expansion

---

### 4. Law of Context

> "A text apart from its context is a pretext."

Interpret within the **immediate** and **book-level** context.

---

## NEW TESTAMENT USE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT

1. **Literal + Fulfillment**:  
   - *Matthew 2:5–6* quotes *Micah 5:2* — Messiah's birth in Bethlehem  
   - *Matthew 1:22–23* quotes *Isaiah 7:14* — Virgin birth

2. **Literal + Typology**:  
   - *Matthew 2:15* → *Hosea 11:1* (Israel as a type of Christ)  
   - *John 19:36* → *Exodus 12:46* (Passover Lamb)

3. **Literal + Application**:  
   - *Matthew 2:17–18* → *Jeremiah 31:15*  
   - *Acts 2:16–21* → *Joel 2*

4. **Summation**:  
   - *Matthew 2:23*, *Luke 18:31–33* – All prophets

## MESSIANIC PROPHECY: 4 TYPES

1. **First Coming**  
   - *Isaiah 53*, *Micah 5:2*

2. **Second Coming**  
   - *Zechariah 14:1–9*, *Isaiah 63:1–6*

3. **Blended**  
   - *Zechariah 9:9–10*, *Isaiah 61:1–2*

4. **Entire Redemptive Career**  
   - *Psalm 22*, *Daniel 7:13–14*

## CONCLUSION

### Key Scriptures to Remember

- **John 5:39** — "These testify about Me."
- **2 Timothy 3:16** — "All Scripture is inspired..."
