# 📖 How to Study the Bible: A Complete Hermeneutical Guide

## 🧭 Overview
This Bible study guide combines the insights of Fruchtenbaum's hermeneutics, inductive Bible study methods from Verse by Verse Ministry, and your personal theological convictions. It is structured to train disciples to **observe**, **interpret**, **evaluate**, and **apply** Scripture — not as a manual for moral rules, but as the grand **revelation of Jesus Christ**.

> "The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed."  
> — Attributed to Augustine, affirmed by Spurgeon & Pink

## 📌 PURPOSE OF SCRIPTURE

**The Bible is not an instruction manual.**  
It is the **revelation of Jesus Christ**, the eternal Word, through whom and for whom all things were made.

> **Revelation 1:1**  
> “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place…” *(NASB1995)*

---

## ✝️ THE CENTRAL MESSAGE: THE REVELATION OF CHRIST

From Genesis to Revelation, the message of Scripture is unified:
- **Old Testament** — anticipates Christ (e.g., sacrifices, covenants, prophecies)
- **New Testament** — reveals Christ (His person, work, and return)

> **John 5:39**  
> "You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;" *(NASB1995)*

> **Luke 24:27**  
> "Then beginning with Moses and with all the Prophets, He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures." *(NASB1995)*

## 🧱 FOUR BASIC ELEMENTS OF INTERPRETATION

### 1. 🔍 Observation – *What does the text say?*
- Pay attention to key words, grammar, structure, and genre.
- Ask: Who? What? When? Where? Why?

> **Hebrews 5:11–14**  
> "...solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to distinguish between good and evil." *(NASB1995)*

---

### 2. 🧠 Interpretation – *What did the author mean?*
- Context is king: historical, grammatical, cultural.
- There is **one intended meaning**, not many.
- Let **Scripture interpret Scripture**.

> **2 Peter 1:20–21**  
> "But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." *(NASB1995)*

---

### 3. 📊 Evaluation & Application – *What truths are timeless?*
- Identify what applies to all believers and what was covenant-specific.
- Application flows from sound interpretation — not emotion or tradition.

> **James 1:22**  
> "But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves." *(NASB1995)*

---

### 4. 🔗 Correlation – *How does it fit the rest of Scripture?*
- Cross-reference and harmonize doctrines.
- Consider dispensational distinctions, covenants, and biblical theology.

> **2 Timothy 3:16–17**  
> "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness..." *(NASB1995)*

## 📜 FOUR RULES OF HERMENEUTICS (Fruchtenbaum)

### 1. 🟨 Golden Rule of Interpretation  
> "When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense."

Take words in their **ordinary, literal meaning** unless context dictates otherwise.

---

### 2. 🟩 Law of Double Reference  
A single passage may refer to **two events or persons** separated by time.

> **Isaiah 61:1–2** ➝ Partial fulfillment in **Luke 4:18–19**

---

### 3. 🟧 Law of Recurrence  
Scripture may revisit the same event with more details.

> **Genesis 1:26–27** ➝ Creation summary  
> **Genesis 2:7–25** ➝ Detailed expansion

---

### 4. 🟥 Law of Context  
> "A text apart from its context is a pretext."

Interpret within the **immediate** and **book-level** context.
